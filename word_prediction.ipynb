       "[\"This place puts a smile on my face...ear to ear, baby!!  So much fun! I knew about this place for awhile, I remember hearing Carl Edwards talk about it on the radio one time, years ago. With my brother and dad visiting from out-of-state about three weeks ago, I suggested we check it out. What a great decision. F1 is not your typical go-kart amusement park let's take a couple of spins around the track and be on our way. It is probably that x100. I'm pretty sure the karts got up to 30-35mph. The slipping and sliding, and constant fishtailing makes for a kick ass ride.  Seriously, it's a great time. You won't be disappointed.  The only negative I could understand people having is that the prices are kind of steep. I would recommend to check out the website, which often include coupons and other offers and memberships.  (Also, check the website for their calendar of events. They do have different track options for different days, and they do have league races which could cause conflict.) Me personally, don't mind paying the money for this type of entertainment, it was a blast! Brought me back to my teenage days, I will definitely check out F1 again!\",\n",

The room itself is fantastic, converted from an old bank, it is incredibly ornate with a huge stained glass dome hanging over the room. Yes I did have the haggis, wrapped in phyllo as an appetizer and it was amazing. The rest of the meal was of equal quality and the service was impeccable.

       " \"Since I was in Vegas for edc weekend one of my friend suggest us to try the shabu restaurant. He had stated thats the only time he will ever eat shabu since he's not a big of a fan of shabu as I am. So as we get there I was like okay there's cars so were going to have to wait, as soon as I walked in there was only one couple in there *awkward cricket noise* I could've sworn this restaurant was super good and worth it by what my friend had said. Anywho, walked in sat down I was excited to try the ponzu & goma sauce the prices for the meat was decent but what I didn't like about it was that it did not taste fresh. The meat tasted & looked like it was bought from a grocery place and then they just placed it really quick onto the plate and made it look nice. The goma sauce was so sweet and the texture of it sucked I tried to add in as much items as I can to take the sweetness away, seemed like they bought that from a grocery store also. The ponzu was okay not bad thats probably the best thing there ... As I got down to making my soup I asked the waitress for soup base but guess what nope they dont have soup base what the f ..  seriously she didnt even supply us with the right tools to get our noodles with [thats no big deal cause either way I know how to use chopsticks] but when she brought us our bowls that just made me not want to be there anymore.. these bowls they brought to us are the bowls that is the smallest one how the hell are you suppose to enjoy your udon in that small ass bowl! really .. I was just glad to leave .. NEVER AGAIN will I go to the shabu in Vegas.If you want real shabu that will definitely not disappoint you, if you're in orange county eat at shabu bar I guarantee you will not be disappointed  in the service, drinks, food, & the awesome workers there.\",\n",
       " \"The food is very mediocre.  The wait is often long, even if you get a table quickly the service and food tends to be slow.

       " 'My husband and I went to visit my nephew at Carnegie Mellon.  It was our first time in Pittsburgh, so we wanted something close to him.  The Shadyside Inn was PERFECT for our stay.  We are very, very, well traveled, and are extremely selective about where we stay.  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that we will be staying here again the next time we come back.  In fact we tried, but the dates we wanted were completely sold out :-(The location is perfect, and only a 5 minute walk from the shops and restaurants on Walnut Street.  You don\\'t even need a car.  The Inn is a series of nicely renovated apartment buildings, so they are all equipped with well-stocked kitchens (my husband is a chef so he was very impressed by that).  The front desk person was sweet and friendly.  Not only did he check us in immediately, he gave us a \"breakfast bag\" full of muffins, juices, and granola bars!  Then he told us that he upgraded us to a suite, even tho we only booked a studio.   Well, when we got into our room, not only was it a suite, but it was a 2 BR suite!  I couldn\\'t believe it.  It was bigger than our apartment back home.  Right then and there I wished we were staying longer - like a month!The suite had a giant flat screen TV, a big dining area, with room service menu, free wi-fi, and super comfy furniture.  The bed was to die for.  The only thing that didn\\'t go was the older, un-renovated bathroom tiles & fixtures, but it really didn\\'t bother us at all, because the shower water pressure was great.  There is ample parking out back, and the service people out taking care of the gardens and rooms were friendly and courteous.When we checked out, they were renovating the main office, so it\\'s nice to see that they are constantly striving to update and improve.  Checkout took less than 30 seconds.  I handed her my key, and they told me they would email me a copy of my bill, since I used my credit card to book.  Everything went so smoothly, and the staff was so wonderful.  We LOVED our stay here and would come back in a heartbeat!',\n",

       " 'They are in fact \"the oldest coffee store\" in Pittsburgh, being created in 1919. I wanted breakfastlunch and nothing was open in Market Square until 11am so this little place caught my eye. They don\\'t roast, pack, or warehouse their products, but roast small batches of Arabican beans daily at optimum temperatures to insure peak flavor. Upon walking in I was greeted with the scintillating waft of fresh coffee beans. Tons of different flavors of Torani syrups also lined the walls, making my decision even that much harder. They had fancy lattes with turtle, chocolate, raspberry, etc enticing names. I decided to stick with one of their brews for the day: Southern Pecan roast and had it just black. It was quite delicious. My sister just asked for a large coffee on ice. I\\'m not sure which roast she ended up with but the flavor was gone after she drenched it with milk and nasty saccharine. Still delicious for an iced coffee but I can\\'t deal with those people that like their coffee in milkshake form. Upon leaving and inspecting the various bags of beans and teas I noticed this place also sells cigars! Hot dog. What a gem.',\n",

So, if you're not from the area and you find yourself in town, this is your chance to learn what cheese in Wisconsin is all about. The smoked mozzarella sticks find me every time.\",\n",

However this was not meant to be. 130 dollars later and Thursday she's already throwing some out. I've ordered before and got nice flowers. I don't know why it's so inconsistent, but I'm done.

mind paying the money for this type of entertainment it was a blast Brought me back to my teenage days I will definitely check out F1 againThis is the first and only korean bbq i have ever visited  that said i cant wait to bring my whole family here at the end of the month for my birthday  I had so much fun filling my plate with marinated treats and cooking them on my table  it was a really amazing and unique  dining experienceif this place sucks compared to the average korean bbq I cant wait to try an outstanding one But for now in Pittsburgh I dont know of anywhere else like it  and Im in loveThis has been a great experience for my kids Sean and his staff are amazing Cant say enough about his teaching and ability to relate to younger kidsWas at this fabulous restaurant last night with clients Thursday night in Edinburgh and at 8pm it was packed when we finally pushed back from the table at 1115 it was still packed In Portland on a Thursday night at 1115 just about everything is closed The room itself is fantastic converted from an old bank it is incredibly ornate with a huge stained glass dome hanging over the room Yes I did have the haggis wrapped in phyllo as an appetizer and it was amazing The rest of the meal was of equal quality and the service was impeccable If you find yourself in the Scottish capital make your way to the domeGreat customer serviceSince I was in Vegas for edc weekend one of my friend suggest us to try the shabu restaurant He had stated thats the only time he will ever eat shabu since hes not a big of a fan of shabu as I am So as we get there I was like okay theres cars so were going to have to wait as soon as I walked in there was only one couple in there awkward cricket noise I couldve sworn this restaurant was super good and worth it by what my friend had said Anywho walked in sat down I was excited to try the ponzu  goma sauce the prices for the meat was decent but what I didnt like about it was that it did not taste fresh The meat tasted  looked like it was bought from a grocery place and then they just placed it really quick onto the plate and made it look nice The goma sauce was so sweet and the texture of it sucked I tried to add in as much items as I can to take the sweetness away seemed like they bought that from a grocery store also The ponzu was okay not bad thats probably the best thing there  As I got down to making my soup I asked the waitress for soup base but guess what nope they dont have soup base what the f   seriously she didnt even supply us with the right tools to get our noodles with thats no big deal cause either way I know how to use chopsticks but when she brought us our bowls that just made me not want to be there anymore these bowls they brought to us are the bowls that is the smallest one how the hell are you suppose to enjoy your udon in that small ass bowl really  I was just glad to leave  NEVER AGAIN will I go to the shabu in VegasIf you want real shabu that will definitely not disappoint you if youre in orange county eat at shabu bar I guarantee you will not be disappointed  in the service drinks food  the awesome workers thereThe food is very mediocre  The wait is often long even if you get a table quickly the service and food tends to be slow  Their fish fry is greasy and boring the rest of the menu items are sometimes decent but overpriced  This place survives on its reputation and the fact that some people dont like food that tastes like anythingAbsolutely delicious Very friendly service as wellGot 2 broths Thai and Chinese with 2 meats shabu beef and pork loin 2 vegetables shiitake mushroom and napa cabbage 1 house special firm tofu and oval noodlesThis place has unmotivated staff whom are mostly not happy or caring to the residents Their standards are poor and utterly sad for any human being Do not waste your breath hereExcellent little place Typical french I ordered the beef bourguignon which is a first  It was delicious and well worth it  Desert try the creme bolle yummyThe service was also excellent the atmosphere intimate I would definitely go there againI drink coffee like its my job Columbia Street Roastery is definitely the place to go to buy coffee or espresso beans Not to mention SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS They carry a variety of flavors decaf  caf blends and there are quite a few choices when it comes to Fair Trade or Organic  Looking for something to do on a Saturday They offer tours of the plant And complimentary tastes   During the summer months they have a booth setup at the Lincoln Square Malls Farmers Market tooIf you want good fish and chips this is the place hand filleted  very light batter on the fish fries are old fashioned not processed and frozen elsewhere The only place that compares is Spud Fish and Chips in Seattle WA on GreenlakeThese are the best fish and chips in the WorldMy husband and I went to visit my nephew at Carnegie Mellon  It was our first time in Pittsburgh so we wanted something close to him  The Shadyside Inn was PERFECT for our stay  We are very very well traveled and are extremely selective about where we stay  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that we will be staying here again the next time we come back  In fact we tried but the dates we wanted were completely sold out The location is perfect and only a 5 minute walk from the shops and restaurants on Walnut Street  You dont even need a car  The Inn is a series of nicely renovated apartment buildings so they are all equipped with wellstocked kitchens my husband is a chef so he was very impressed by that  The front desk person was sweet and friendly  Not only did he check us in immediately he gave us a breakfast bag full of muffins juices and granola bars  Then he told us that he upgraded us to a suite even tho we only booked a studio   Well when we got into our room not only was it a suite but it was a 2 BR suite  I couldnt believe it  It was bigger than our apartment back home  Right then and there I wished we were staying longer  like a monthThe suite had a giant flat screen TV a big dining area with room service menu free wifi and super comfy furniture  The bed was to die for  The only thing that didnt go was the older unrenovated bathroom tiles  fixtures but it really didnt bother us at all because the shower water pressure was great  There is ample parking out back and the service people out taking care of the gardens and rooms were friendly and courteousWhen we checked out they were renovating the main office so its nice to see that they are constantly striving to update and improve  Checkout took less than 30 seconds  I handed her my key and they told me they would email me a copy of my bill since I used my credit card to book  Everything went so smoothly and the staff was so wonderful  We LOVED our stay here and would come back in a heartbeatDan is the manThey are in fact the oldest coffee store in Pittsburgh being created in 1919 I wanted breakfastlunch and nothing was open in Market Square until 11am so this little place caught my eye They dont roast pack or warehouse their products but roast small batches of Arabican beans daily at optimum temperatures to insure peak flavor Upon walking in I was greeted with the scintillating waft of fresh coffee beans Tons of different flavors of Torani syrups also lined the walls making my decision even that much harder They had fancy lattes with turtle chocolate raspberry etc enticing names I decided to stick with one of their brews for the day Southern Pecan roast and had it just black It was quite delicious My sister just asked for a large coffee on ice Im not sure which roast she ended up with but the flavor was gone after she drenched it with milk and nasty saccharine Still delicious for an iced coffee but I cant deal with those people that like their coffee in milkshake form Upon leaving and inspecting the various bags of beans and teas I noticed this place also sells cigars Hot dog What a gemThe Irish Nachos were a bit bland  We came in to get an appetizer  meal and possibly desert  but once the waitress took our drink and appetizer order  she never took our meal order  I guess if you are not drinking bear or whiskey you can forget about serviceReally good food and good service The Chinese is the best and most authentic in the areaCopious samples garnish the aisles Local flavor is found at every turn Then theres the annual selection of selection of World Championship cheeses Brennans is the single most place that I recommend all who visit Madison to visit Plenty of people drive along the many cheese barns of the interstate only to find a selection of novelty items and subpar cheeses So if youre not from the area and you find yourself in town this is your chance to learn what cheese in Wisconsin is all about The smoked mozzarella sticks find me every timeI dont know why its such a hit or miss thing with flowers I ordered a dozen roses from the rose shack for my wife for valentines day They told me they get fresh roses on Monday So I figure Ill have them delivered Tuesday that way theyll be fresh and she can enjoy them all week However this was not meant to be 130 dollars later and Thursday shes already throwing some out Ive ordered before and got nice flowers I dont know why its so inconsistent but Im done Ill find something else to do on valentines day5 star reviews arent just for the fanciest places on Earth  Oh no  5 stars within a class  Bandaids is in its own class of dirty run down last stop stripper establishments and within that class Bandaids is primo  Ive never had a bad time here  Never']"
