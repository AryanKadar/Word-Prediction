Literally anything off the menu is going to burst with flavor.  The Stone House and the Stable Grill both offer really cool experiences; be sure to take a walk through the cool tunnel that serves as a wine cellar and connects the two.I think Quivey's Grove is best enjoyed when you're planning to spend an hour or so at the bar waiting for a table, preferably on one of those cold winter nights where it's so brutal that you can't stand the walk from the car to the restaurant door.  Quivey's practically exists to keep you warm.\",\n",

If they don't have something you're looking for in stock, they'll gladly order it for you, and they were very helpful when I was trying to find out whether an old jazz record had been reissued on CD.

Furs and fedoras, and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways. This is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares. I have not experienced large playhouses in other cities. But my advice is pick a show you love a decent Broadway one, splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable. Spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience. I don't think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to, if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view. And unlike Heinz hall you have a little leg room. There are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint. The ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late (Grrr that Pittsburgh parking), speaking of parking I would park at the 9th and Penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can. I appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions, I think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other American cities has been left to decay.

       " 'Ok, I\\'m writing this review after going to this place about 4 times. It is conveniently located near my house so having just moved here I thought id give it a shot since my regular nail place was in Tempe Marketplace and I felt lazy to go there that day. First time, I got a pedi and full set and had no issues. I did notice the quality was lower than the job they had done at my other place but I was ok with it. That particular day they were busy and I think her son and bf were both helping out. It\\'s a family business which I think is great. Second time was a fill and pedi. She seemed to be n a rush and my nails were all sloppy and the clear coat wasn\\'t covering the whole nail, some nails weren\\'t even and  just a sloppy job. She asked me who had done my nails... I told her she had (the owner).Third time, I went in... Same thing... The girl doing my pedi n French tip couldn\\'t get it right.... They were all uneven and almost looked like they used whiteout for the tips. Messy. When the owner started doing my nails she noticed I kept looking at my toes and she offered to take a look after my nails were done. Well. Again, she saw the sloppy work from the previous time and AGAIN asked me who had done my nails... I told her it was her.  She finished and again.... Same thing... Nails not even... Clear coat not covering entire nail and bumps all over. I hate complaining so I just asked she looked at my toes which she did and had the girl redo them... I felt bad. I came back a couple days later cause I broke a nail and I mentioned to her about the clear coat and I showed her... And she fixed it. She also fixed my broke nail and it looked weird cause she did it (again) like always in a hurry and it was not as wide as the other nails. Whatever I left. I went back yesterday (111813) and she meets me at door saying \"oh we too busy\" it\\'s only three of them working.... And I was like \"ok\" (sounded like she was telling me to go!!) I said it\\'s ok I can wait....  Well I should\\'ve left!!!! I decided to get my toenails red... That\\'s how bad I didn\\'t want the girl to try doing the French tip! I never paint my toe nails red!! Ever!!! Then (the owner) started looking at my nails and she AGAIN asked me who had done them cause they didn\\'t look good and asked why that broken nail SHE had fixed wasn\\'t as wide as the others!!!!!!! I told her it was herself and she shut up. She honestly seems to be very very lazy and ALWAYS ALWAYS in a hurry. I\\'m not the type of person that complains but I don\\'t like telling u how to do your job either cause I don\\'t like others telling me how to do mine. But this time... I had had it. I asked her to fix several things... And then she puts the clear coat... And tells me to put my hands n the dryer thingy... Once my nails were done.. I pull them out and she files the edges a bit... And she damages one of the nails n the side taking off the clear coat... I tell her and she said \"oh u did it when u out ur hand down\" SHE WAS STILL HOLDING MY HAND!!!  And then I asked her about three other nails not fully covered with clear coat.  She reapplied and after 2 mins n the dryer thing she said I was done. I looked at my nails and she could see I was upset.  Because she just reapplied clear on too of the other clear that wasn\\'t even dry.. There\\'s bumps and u can see the ridges of the little brush....  I was supposed to get my eyebrows done but i was scared she would just wax it all off... So I told her never mind. As I\\'m paying she sees I\\'m not happy cause I keep looking at my nails and she says... \"U ok I fix for u\" I said \"don\\'t worry about it\"... I paid.. Left no tip and walked out. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but not anymore.Her work is very VERY VERY SLOPPY.... She is ALWAYS is a hurry and ALWAYS understaffed. I would never recommend this place to anyone cause they will be very unhappy with her work. I wished she had more pride n what she does. Being n the customer service field I know that when I\\'m with a customer... That\\'s my only customer and I concentrate n them and only them. To rush and have a bad product or service is just not good business. If u go there, be ready to wait at least 30 minutes before being seen.',\n",

Before I moved to Charlotte, I had my stylist do an all-over color to bring me back to my original hair color and wipe out my years of highlights so I didn't have to find someone right away after moving for upkeep. After a year and a half, I finally decided to brave the daunting task of finding a new salon so I could be back to my blonde alter ego. Girls in my office had been recommending Modern for months, but I decided to take my chances elsewhere. Bad choice. After 3 sub-par highlights, I looked like a tiger (in a bad, orange and streaky kind of way) and gave in to their insistence that I try Modern. Man, do I feel silly that I wasted so much time and money at other salons! Sandy, a stylist at Modern, was not only one of the nicest people I've ever met, but she did an outstanding job on my hair. She understood exactly what I relayed to her and went above and beyond in doing a deep conditioning treatment and explaining what we could do next time to make my hair look even better. Sandy is a true professional and really listened to what I was saying about how my hair reacts to different things and they way I like it to look (unlike the other places I had gone, hence the tiger-head.) After a wonderful head massage during the deep conditioning treatment and a fantastic blow-out, i was on my way to face the world looking 100% better than when I walked in. I would recommend Sandy's services to anyone who wants to look fabulous.\",\n",

My hair is long, thick, and curly. So I found Modern Salon just a few blocks away from my hotel. When I first got there the lady that took care of me was very polite even after she realized that blow-drying my hair would take a lifetime. She scurried of to speak to her supervisor or maybe a more experienced stylist for suggestions on what products or brushes to use. Nikki came along and was extremely knowledgeable with my textured type of hair; she had an amazing attitude not only to satisfy the customer but also towards the not so experienced stylist, they are lucky to have her as a mentor. I don\\'t usually write reviews but after the experience I had at that salon I think it\\'s worth writing a review to mention the professionalism and the positive attitude of the salon. I did mention to Nikki this is probably the first time I\\'ve ever had anyone \"understand\" my hair. She didn\\'t take forever to blow dry my hair because she knew what she was doing.

       " \"I am a sales associate for a company called Sleep America.  I have an appreciation for sales techniques and I am a tough critic. I was greeted immediately by a man named Alex Parsons with a smile. He was dressed sharp and was very clean cut. He asked a few qualifying questions which I appreciated. I had brought in an expensive pair of shoes with me in hopes to find a belt to match. He asked for the shoe and immediately found a great belt in my size. He then asked if I would be interested in a pair of slacks to try it on with. (which was a seamless transition into an upsell... much appreciated) but the important thing to note... he asked not told. I said absolutely I would. He pulled around 6 options and continued to explain the different materials as well as styles. I decided on a flat front pair of pants made of whool. (great quality as well) I asked for a shirt to complete my ensemble. Unfortunately I have a difficult body frame and have a difficult time finding the correct fit and size. He even went to the trouble of asking the tailor to take a look. I felt like I was getting royal treatment and Alex spent a great amount of time with me, answering all of my questions, and meanwhile tidying up the store and giving me space. I decided to purchase the slacks, with a permanent crease, and had them hem the slacks as well. I was out the door with a new belt, a pair of great slacks and shoe pollish to boot! Thank you Alex for all of your great work. I have already referred a co-worker and he purchased two pairs of slacks and two shirts. The Tempe Marketplace store is fantastic, but more importantly, Alex was fantastic. I would prep him for a promotion if I was in management because he has all of the qualities of a manager. If anyone is reading this and thinking of purchasing from this location, call and ask for Alex. He really suprised me because many of the reviews are so-so.

Turns out their smoothies are quite fantastic as well. I believe the general consensus amongst my friends and I has been \"heaven in our mouths.\"On top of that, their selection of local produce and related products is unrivaled. Delicious fresh fruit (of which they\\'re usually handing out samples), local honey, locally made salad dressings, salsas, jams, and much much more, make this place to die for. I get all of my best fruit here, without a doubt.One thing to note though is that you should bring cash here!

I like this Y better than the other ones around Charlotte mostly because it's not always super crowded and you almost never have to wait to use a machine.

Furs and fedoras, and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways. This is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares. I have not experienced large playhouses in other cities. But my advice is pick a show you love a decent Broadway one, splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable. Spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience. I don't think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to, if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view. And unlike Heinz hall you have a little leg room. There are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint. The ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late (Grrr that Pittsburgh parking), speaking of parking I would park at the 9th and Penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can. I appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions, I think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other American cities has been left to decay. Cue in Detroit, sadly. So props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going.... true Pittsburgh beauty,\",\n",

       " \"So I came on a Saturday night and this place was - amazing! I have been to almost all of the clubs in old town and I have to say this is by far one of the best.I always go mainly to dance and this place was packed and everyone who was on the dance floor danced! Sometimes people are mingling on the dance floor, talking, or only slightly putting effort (in other words, taking up prime space) but people here actually danced! It seems silly, but this is amazing. It encourages other people to do the same and gives a highly energetic vibe to this place. Very attractive. Like people just don't give a f*** and want to have a good time. That's exactly how I like it.The atmosphere was not only created by the enthusiastic crowd but the incredible lighting as well. Ethereal is the best word for it - not too dark, not too bright for the dance floor, and then outside of the dance floor, just bright enough and yet still somehow maintained very low-lighting. I'm not sure how they achieve this balance, but I'm pretty sure it's magic. The decor, appearance, and condition of this place is absolutely gorgeous. The way it was designed is stunning, like a Victoria Secret's model - glamorous, sexy, laced with elegance, and bejeweled with luxury. I also love the layout of this place. Once you enter, you hit the dance floor, which is circular like Maya's, those are the best (between the people and setting, it was the most comfortable dance floor I have ever danced on - people who just wanted to have fun, danced, were very attractive, and chill). You can then go around the dance floor to the bars to get a drink or continue all the way to the back to get a break from dancing. Back there is an extremely nice lounge area where you can lay back, relax, and have a drink and chat. I can't express how much I love this large lounge area in the back, I adore it, I adore it, I adore it. It has so much space, room, and (comfortable!) seating with intimate couches and spinning chairs and it's like a glamorous, long, break room or like another club all together. Yes I love dancing, but hell I need a break for water and a chat too! The bathrooms are back there as well. For those that need it, there's also a long and large outdoor patio with seating.By the dance floors there are actually platforms which you can stand on and dance on, sometimes my friends and I dance on them. They're really convenient when the actual dance floor gets too crowded and you can just hop on one of those. But I do believe they're actually for the go-go dancers that come on Wednesday night. Oops, owell haha. Alright, so I actually did not order a drink here or use the bathroom which are kind of my requirements for giving an honest to goodness complete review, so I'll be back to update on drink prices and quality and whatnot. Honestly I just danced the night away this visit, and loved every second of it. WILL BE BACK. Love you Mint. Oh yeah, and the cover charge for men is $10, while women pay nada. Woo. Love it. The lines were rather short, I think I waited 10 minutes tops. And the people at the front were very friendly and nice, no attitude whatsoever.Possibly because of the cover charge, there were more women than men - whoa rare I know, and there was a variety of ethnicities, so all in all, great mix. In addition to that, it was the first time where I had seen more than 3 attractive guys at a club, haha. Lots of attractive people here, men and women. I don't know what it is but I guess a good looking and feeling club attracts good looking and feeling people. How else could you explain it. First and only club I've seen so many good looking people!I'm coming back here asap. Next weekend. Doing this. Every weekend. If possible. Sorry Maya, Smashboxx, and INTL, but I found a better lover. We can keep it an open relationship if you'd like. I don't mind.\",\n",

And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing hereThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.AND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early.\",\n",

I ordered the same 2 drinks AGAIN.... charge: $21.50 (before tip) Now.... howwhy did the price increase from $18.50 to $21.50 in the course of an hour and a half Unless it was a rip off  (several complaints heard about weak or NO ALCOHOL mixed drinks at $9 apiece) The dance floor was ok.

At least a dozen tables spill outside the doors, filled with patrons and their cherished pets on any warm evening. It's commonplace to have live music from the patio, but doesn't overpower the conversations or keep the dogs from lounging. The ambiance, especially with the views of the lake and paddle boats, allows you to shift your mind into thinking you're anywhere but a local hangout in the Piedmont of NC. The Vault itself has tiny quarters, but stocks some well-treasured and fresh names, both in wine and brews. Snacks are available, with a varied assortment of cheeses, pretzels and party mix. It's very simple to walk in, make your selections, then take to the register for purchase. The only problem you may find are long lines, so I wouldn't wait until the last minute for a drink or the bathroom.

This place has been here for years, and as I sit drinking my bitter, bitter coffee, and smelling the overwhelming scent of (I believe) dog pee, I wonder how it\\'s even possible.  The three times I\\'ve been here, I\\'m greeted as if I\\'m a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent.  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them, then duck out of the way.  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them.  If I didn\\'t, I\\'m convinced that they would just sit there, as if they\\'re not certain of what position they hold in this place, or what the next step should even be.  This is what I like to call, \"The Dance of Shitty Customer Service.\"  Today (and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe) I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded, and I figured the quiet would be a good thing.  The girl at the counter was on the phone, and that\\'s the way it stayed for two minutes until I said \\'excuse me\\'.  The charming reply: \"Yeah\" She grudgingly got off the phone, and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup, I pumped this swill that I\\'m currently drinking.She\\'s currently muttering under her breath back in her corner.  I\\'m not sure if maybe she\\'s having a bad day, or she\\'s just an asshole, but...if I had to bet, I\\'m going with asshole.This place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is, and the food...Just don\\'t eat the food.  (side note: this place isn\\'t quiet at all when somebody orders something.  She stomps around like she\\'s being sent to her room.  Then continues muttering)Okay, so this place is a travesty.  Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service.  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place.  As it is now, it\\'s cornered the market in Regent Square, and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of Braddock Avenue.',\n",

       " \"One thing Pittsburgh is not known for, but should be, is turning old churches into businesses, homes and even bars (gasp!).  Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! If you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). It's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! The Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!There's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   It's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!This is your place for one unique stay, I wouldn't steer you wrong!\",\n",

From my vegetarian to foodie (or chowhound) friends have found something (usually more) that keeps them coming back. Many thank me for having introduce them to this jewel of a restaurant.

At no point did he try to upsell anything (in fact, he didn't even ask me about a budget). He just gave me a few things to think about before I invest in something new.

At first I thought it was just sarcastic \"Soup Nazi\" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I\\'ve seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.Also, it\\'s downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show\\'s over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I\\'d ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  The kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I\\'ve ever been to in Madison where I\\'ve been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don\\'t take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn\\'t trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.In short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it\\'s not worth going there if you\\'re going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.

       " 'This review is based on observing my daughter\\'s class in the \\'firecrackers\\' group...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY FOR \\'FIRST TIMERS\\' OR INEXPERIENCED TODDLERS. How class goes; there are two instructors per class. One instructor gives a quick demonstration giving them instructions what to do on the equipment at each station. The kids chose which station they want to start at and then they rotate from station to station. What I\\'ve been seeing; all the kids are at different skill levels, different heights, different ages, and some are better at following directions than others. While some of the children are able and capable of maneuvering around the equipment themselves other children who are too little or inexperienced end up waiting around until either A. The instructors finally make their way to helping a different station, B. a kid gets impatient and has to ask the instructor for help or C. The child gets bored and starts wandering around and doing whatever they please, getting in the way of the other kids. Let me be honest and say, my daughter was definitely \\'C\\'. She is too short to reach most of the equipment on her own, she is also inexperienced in gymnastics and she has a high energy level with very little attention span. Throughout most of class she was waiting around for help, get bored and do her own thing ultimately getting in the way of everyone else. Several times neither of the instructors noticed that she walked away to another class or was off in a corner away from everyone just playing by herself. The instructors neglect in engaging with the children. All I have seen them do is spot the children on the equipment. They do not have any kind of activities for the children to do together as a class, they do nothing to make their learning experience a fun experience. I\\'m not trying to tell anyone how to do their jobs but perhaps it could be beneficial to divide the kids into two groups, one group per instructor and start at two different stations rotating together, keeping the kids into two groups instead of four-five. Maybe that way the kids can each possibly get more attention from the instructor and even be kept an eye on more easily. I don\\'t know if it would work, but its a suggestion...they definitely need to rethink what they can do to better organize the class as a whole and better engage the kids, it would be appreciated for them to evaluate what they can do to maximize the services they are being paid for. I absolutely did not respect one of the instructors putting my daughter on a time out during a class. He said she was too hyper and he didn\\'t want she or any of the kids to get hurt so he put her on a time out to calm down. I understand that he was thinking of their safety BUT I didn\\'t believe a time out was fair because honestly if they had been paying more attention they would have noticed her standing in line waiting to be helped for almost 10mins before she decided to have free play. And each time she went to another station she would wait for so long before getting bored. Can you blame her (or any other kid) she\\'s only 4, five minutes to them is equivalent to 30-60 minutes. I am not upset about the time out itself, I do believe in discipline, I care that she got put in time out for entertaining herself due to the lack or organization by the instructors. Truthfully the class looks like \\'free play\\' being monitored by instructors who only help them on the equipment...after they wait and wait and wait until one of them are available. They could improve their class by adding activities and games that relate to gymnastics and can help bring the class together as a whole. Also...I can\\'t stress this enough...the instructors really need to engage with the children rather than just \"spotting\" them on the equipment. Fortunately I used a Groupon deal before deciding to register for regular classes. She has one more class to complete and then we will be looking into other gymnastic businesses.  I am exceptionally disappointed with the experience my daughter has had with this company. Fortunately she is only 4 so she doesn\\'t know the difference, but she will absolutely not be returning.',\n",

There is a film on the windows, and a pair of children's shoes strewn across the waiting area.  The child I think they belong to is actually standing on top of chairs SCREAMING for his mom. This is AWFUL.  There is also a dirty, empty bucket just outside of the front door. I'm not sure why, but eww!! The men's room is SO GROSS, and there's just all sorts of eww everywhere! My best instinct tells me I shouldn't have bothered, but I gave it a whirl, and... The food wasn't *horrible*. The fried rice was really bland. The Egg Drop Soup was kinda barfy. It had nasty peas corn and carrots, and the vegetables had been dehydrated.. they weren't dehydrated very well. My entree was General Tso's Chicken. It was certainly the highlight of the experience, but the chicken itself seemed oddly dense, and of low quality. The prices weren't super great either. I'm guessing all the hype is about the Dim Sum, and the more exotic seafood offerings. I'm still in disbelief that they would not accept the check-in special, filth factor makes me wonder what kind of public health hazard China King is.\",\n",

I have not even been able to go over to the weight lifting section of the gym after 3 weeks of membership - thanks to the kids club.   Also, have to leave classes early which is disruptive i.e. in yoga..... again.. thanks to kids club.  The girls who work there are snotty and make snide remarks if you are even a couple of minutes late.    I have written a letter to \"corporate\", but I am told that I will never get a response.   So.... once again... as a single working mother with child... I feel that I am paying more than the average person to work out there.. plus I am not able to work out as long as other people who pay less.   Completely frustrating.   I signed up for 800.00 worth of Summer Kids Camps...which I have subsequently withdrawn from due to the bad attitude of the Kid\\'s Club employees.

Our tickets (thank you Yelp!) were in the orchestra level and we had a great view of the production.  I was surprised at how many other kids were in the theater, and I think for the length and time of night I wouldn\\'t have wanted to take anyone younger than my almost-six-year-old.So, the ballet. It was set in Pittsburgh, which was fun, and there were some additions we hadn\\'t see before, like the mysterious Nephew.  The dancing was wonderful, as expected.  My daughter was confused about the lack of dialog, but the program had a very helpful synopsis that helped her understand what was happening.  The first act was fun, with magic acts, dancing \"dolls\" and of course the fight with the rats and mice, and quite enjoyable.  The ending of the first act was quite soothing, and in the dark theater I admit I was afraid of snoozing!The second act.  The national dances were amazing, especially the arabian dance (Holy cow, talk about amazing abs!!!).  Then it got to the point where the sugar plum fairy danced, then her consort danced, then they danced together, then the fairy danced...and it did drag a little.  I loved the creativity, though, of the carousel, and the imagination of the set and costumes.  There was a part with the lambs that was awfully cute, and we loved watching the kids any time they were on stage.  There were several \"side stories\" going on in the periphery of the stage that you could get absorbed in, and it was just very well done.

And doubly impressed that it was listed as one of the magazine's top 25 restaurants in the city. With a build up like that, I was very excited to dine here. We had an early evening reservation. The exterior is described as 3 story Victorian. Looked like a homely dump to me. Inside was a very different story. Sleek and modern, with a Zen like garden feel, we were excited as little kids to be lead to table on the 3rd floor near the bar area. I thought the atmosphere was tranquil and very romantic. I started with the thai corn chowder with crab meat. I was taken aback by the color, a sort of dreary garymustard. But it was very delicious, very spicy. My BBF had a salad that was very flavorful with chicken and fresh spring greens. We were also served an appetizer with cucumber and pita chips. For dinner, we had the filet mignon and the seafood hot pot. The filet was extremely thick and served with a nice vegetable mixture and potatoes.  The flavor was amazing.  The seafood looked delicious, I sampled the shrimp and they were very well seasoned. Dessert was also just as amazing. We shared the vanilla-roasted Asian pear served with a gingerbread biscuit, Asian pear sorbet and sabayon. We also shared a chai spiced creme caramel flan. It was so yummy with pumpkin seed brittle and vanilla chantilly. All in all a very special evening. Everything was wonderfully presented and service was very good.

The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. - Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. - The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20searly 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs.

Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them.

Are you serious FREE He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point.

I say this because he did it for me many times over the years that I lived walking distance from the store. Their fresh, Amish turkeys are the best you can get for Thanksgiving. You do need to order those in advance, however. If you don't see what you're looking for in the display case, just ask. He would custom cut a chunk of center sirloin for me - he always had a primal in stock, not frozen. He would let me hang out in the lobby and talk meat on Saturday mornings, between customers. I wanted to help out behind the counter, just to learn from the team, but they hire young people to work the counter, and I couldn't take a job as a hobby that someone else needed to get thru school, etc. Long story short - If you likelove meat, but can't tell a ribeye from a strip, this is the place to go. They will help you make a decision, and how to treat the meat if need be. Remember - the only stupid question is the one that never gets asked. You needn't worry that you will be looked down upon if you ask a novice grilling question. This is not a pretentious boutique. It's a friendly, helpful business that truly values your business, and they will help you make some killer meat!\",\n",

       " \"I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel (IHG brand).  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.The hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  In the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location.\",\n",

Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine\\'s was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone, possibly the best rolls I\\'ve had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also deliciousFor my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me mention, the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING. I don\\'t care if it\\'s not authentic! Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good. I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, \"Slow down, it\\'s not going anywhere!\" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don\\'t normally like, but the flavor was just too good! Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn\\'t even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I\\'ve actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, and I\\'m already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I\\'m biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did I!).Unfortunately, neither of us were able to leave room for dessert, so I have nothing to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It\\'s such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I\\'d rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me feel like I\\'ve gone back in time. It\\'s such a cozy, romantic restaurant.

The food is either completely bland (e.g., my curry, which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldn\\'t even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor.

       " \"I read a few negative reviews from other unhappy customers but I thought I would try this place out anyway. When I arrived my wife and I met Alladin, shop owner, who seemed very confident. He said he worked with pro athletes and sounded like he knew what he was talking about. He tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money. Later I purchased an $800 Hugo Boss suit and came back to see him to have it altered. He made all of the necessary markings and pinned the back of the jacket to be altered. A week later I came with my wife to pick up the suit and he handed me the wrong suit (good thing I checked). He didn't ask me to try the right one on so I asked if I could make sure it fit. Long story short, he never altered the jacket and the pants seam was off. He tried to charge $200 for doing nothing to the jacket which is a scam. He finally agreed to fix the jacket so sent us to lunch and made some adjustments. He didn't know how to work with the modern Hugo Boss material and you could see the stitching marks from the hem on the outside of the pants legs . WHAT A JOKE! I was going to seek legal advice but figured I would spend more on a lawyer than just making the ruined suit work. If you need anything complicated done or if you are have anything of value do not use this guy! PLEASE BEWARE and don't ignore these complaints like I did. There are other negative reviews out there if you look.\",\n",

       " 'Putting aside the fact that when i first went, they had some bad impressions (owner on vacation, closed shop for over a week, no ingredients to make ice cream to replenish stock, etc). If i based the review on that only, i\\'d probably give them 1-2 stars. But i gave them many chances to recover.Located on the SW corner of Tropicana and Ft Apache, next door to Tropical Smoothie (take note the address from yelp, on more than one occassion, has led the person to the area down the street). Easy way to get to this place would be turning right at the Hobby Lobby sign on Ft apache, and then taking a left. I had first heard about this place from a friend, saying they had durian ice cream. i was ecstatic to hear this news and been waiting a LONG time to try this place. There are 3 different \"areas\" of ice cream. First is the normal type containing like chocolate, banana chocolate, pistachio, etc. Second is the asian type containing green tea, lychee, taro, black sesame, ginger, mango, durian, and guava. Last but not least, something catered to the lactose intolerant, 100% non-dairy ice cream, with flavors of i believe vanilla, chocolate, and mango All the ice cream is made by the owner himself, Peter Wong. He lets you try as many flavors as you want, and he gives you a decent amount (way more than other places for samples). Something good to note is all the ice creams are not overly sweet. They are sweet but very fragrant. All of the ice cream are soft, and very smooth. I\\'ve tried most of the asian flavors, including some of the normal, and one of the non-dairy style. Starting by my favorite type, asian flavors ! My least favorite is probably the ginger. There is a slight spice from the ginger that you can taste. Nothing spicy but its like a subtle but noticeable spice. The taro is one of the lighter ones as well. Fragrant , light, with very small taro bits. No artificial coloring (not deep purple like you see in stores, but like very very light purple).The mango and lychee are nice. Sweeter, but fragrant depending on the fruit. The guava (new) is nice. Really fragrant, not too sweet. Out of the \"ordinary\" asian flavored ice cream. The last two is black sesame and durian (so i just noticed ive never tried green tea... hmm) first the black sesame. Made with actual ground black sesame. VERY fragrant. Slightly sweet. Its like the ice cream version of the hot black sesame soup dessert. i love it ! And last but not least, durian. BE WARNED. this is one of the asian fruits where you either will love it, or hate it. It has a very distinct flavor and smell. This is my favorite, along with the black sesame. the durian has a light yellow color. Gives off the actual durian fragrance that you\\'d expect from the fruit. Same for the taste as well. Very fragrant, slightly sweet. As for the normal flavors, i havent had the chance to try yet, ive been stuck on the asian flavors, but when i visited today, Peter let me try a new creation of his, which was the banana chocolate chip. He said its made with real bananas ! this flavor was really fragrant in terms of the banana. not too sweet either. Honestly, almost rather prefer it without the chocolate chip. the chocolate chip makes it kind of weird Now last but not least, something a lot of places dont offer. 100% non-dairy ice cream. When i had first visited this place, my uncle was complaining about not being able to try any because of his lactose intolerance. Luckily, Peter just created (that day..) something new. 100% non dairy ice cream. My uncle was super happy. Peter was very careful, made sure to not use a scoop that was prior used in the other ice creams. As i had said earlier, there was 3 flavors he had made. When he was getting a sample for my uncle, he said the ice cream was made earlier, and has not completely set yet, but because its been maybe 1-2 hours since freezing process started, there are some areas he was able to get that was solidified. I forgot which flavor was tasted but the texture and flavor was good. Of course its not as fragrant as if using normal dairy products, but it was still good for what it is. Flavorful, semi sweet, and of course, smooth. Highly recommended place for ice cream. Prices are very good as well.Starting at $2.50 for 1 scoop up to $5.50 for 4 scoops. They aren\\'t small scoops either ! :D',\n",

My personal experience with this establishment yesterday was unpleasant. Walked in yesterday late afternoon to try this place and there\\'s a family on one table enjoying their ice cream and two Chinese female in their early twenties who wear a hoochie mama type of clothing ahead of me ordering.  The Chinese dude in his 50\\'s taking orders is somewhat extra nice to these 2, which is fine, suggesting to sample all the diff type of ice cream. When female one ordered, he asked female 2 about what she wants and she said she didn\\'t want any. The Chinese counter guy said \" oh u should\\'ve tasted more free samples while u were waiting\"..., my point is when it was our turn, my daughter tried one flavor of ice cream and when she wants to try another flavor, the guy had this annoyed look and said \" I can let her try another flavor but I need to scoop the ice cream & drop it to to her \"USED PLASTIC SPOON\".... What a rude ass!  He said its a waste to give my daughter a new spoon! That\\'s the 1st reasons why they scored one.2nd - while he\\'s about to do my Boba, the family who\\'s about to leave decided to order some soda, the bastard stop and took their freaking order. Not sure if I have the look of a PUSH OVER, but I know my face doesn\\'t look friendly anymore.Last, the register broke. The dude was now clueless on what to do so the family who were paying for the soda helped him to figure out what they owe.After 20 minutes of hell and mistreatment, he can probably tell I\\'m about to explode and let him have it.... He gave me a scoop of ice cream to top my Boba for the inconvenience and I can tell from his face, he don\\'t really wants to do this.To be honest, the wait doesn\\'t bother me but the fact that this perv was ALL nice and giddy to these young hoochie female and he wants us to re use our freaking plastic spoon the it\\'s reason of the 1 star.

The walls are lined with glass drug store display cases - now filled with an assortment of glass ware and interesting ice cream parlor related paraphernalia. I heard about Klavon\\'s first while watching a WQED special on the strip district.  When the special was filmed, the second generation of owners (the son and wife of the founders) had recently passed away. The parlor stayed closed for a few years according to my fiance.

I was greatly surprised to find out that their summer hours go till 9:00pm on Sundays!

Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  The fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.

The style has character and thankfully does not clutter the walls with kitchy decorations. The staff is very friendly as well as attentive. We ordered fried calamari rings and catfish shrimp combos with drinks. The prices are very reasonable, although there was a discrepancy on the chalk written price. The fish is freshly battered on the spot and the food is cooked in a timely manner. The batter and oil for each food item is specialized. The calamari rings were excellent with the marinara sauce. They were not too crunchy and not too rubbery, just perfect. The catfish came in three long strips over steak fries, three shrimp, and sides of sauces. Moist, tender, crunchy, and packed with flavor is how I would describe both the catfish and butterfly shrimp. The green tea reminds me of the imported teas in international markets in california.

I will never do that again!Biggest issue:  The bill came and I noticed just about 30% added to the bill as \"tax\" ... yes, 30%!  When I asked the server about it, he said that that includes 18% as service fee and 8.1% as tax ... and that that is explained in the menu.  I have several issues with this:1. Shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print ... my mistake, but if you are reading this review, you don\\'t have to make this mistake.2. Why am I forced to leave an 18% tip  The tip is not at my discretion.  If the server is not helpful, I can\\'t express myself in any way.  3. Why is listed as \"tax\"  I bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically!!!  That is stealing!4. Now, it gets worse:  I asked the server that if there is an 18% service fee plus an 8.1% tax, that adds up to 26.1%.  So, why is there an almost 30% charge  They add 8.1% to the bill and then they add 18% tip on top of it.  So, the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18%.Food:  It was no special in any way.  I am very familiar with Persian food.  I have had it in many cities and many countries.  I look for Persian restaurants everywhere I go.  This restaurant is not bad but it is not good either.  The food in NO WAY justifies the prices they charge!  I had chicken with bones, and it was not cooked well.  For appetizer, we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan, and we had it with two kinds of stew.  Tadig was good but not enough for 6 people.  Stews were OK, but again not special.Service:  It was OK.  The server was not really pleasant: smiling or welcoming.  He was not rude or anything, but I felt like we were bothering him being there.  And the place was not busy.  The service in NO WAY justified more than 18% in tip.  But think about it the guy didn\\'t care because he knew he will get his tip any way.

       " 'The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was originally a movie theater called The Stanley. It was built in 1927 and was billed as \"Pittsburgh\\'s Palace of Amusement.\" It\\'s acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built, 65 cents would not only buy you a \"photoplay\", but you\\'d also get live entertainment too. A two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the U.S. Department of the Interior brought it back to its original condition. The grand lobby\\'s mirrors and woodwork are all original. Of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater, only one is a replica. In fact, the main chandelier weighs 4,700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The sightlines here are awesome. It truly is a masterpiece of theater design. Let\\'s face it fellow Yelpers, you\\'re not here for my architectural reviews are you Okay. I came here last night for the Decemberists concert featuring Justin Townes Earle as the opener. There were only single seats left when I tried to get tickets. So I ended up going by myself to the show. Hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion! The Portland, OR based Decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their CD \"The King Is Dead\" has been doing quite well. So much so that it reached 1 on the Billboard Charts in late January. The Decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called \"progressive rock\" and British folk but this new CD is definitely more of an AmericanaAlt Country sound. So much so that the single \"Down by the Water\" reminds me of Firetown\\'s \"The Good Life\" for some reason (Firetown later evolved into Garbage--in both senses of the word.. But that\\'s another story). So it was no surprise that after doing \"The Crane Wife, Parts 1-3\", Colin Meloy told the audience \"I don\\'t know who wrote the set list, but they thought we were a prog band. We\\'re not a prog band anymore. We\\'re a folk band.\" Hmmm! That actually was a pretty apt description. Despite this, they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue. There was plenty of good singin\\' and good playin\\' though. Sam Watkins of Nickel Creek played fiddle against Jenny Conlee\\'s accordion and they did a rousing Irish jig to the song \"Rox in the Box\". It was almost strange though how Meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song \"Rise to Me\". They also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show, and face it folks, you can\\'t keep a good prog band down! But anyway, this show proved that the Decemberists aren\\'t some flash in the pan. Their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they\\'re in it for the long haul. I should also mention that my 60-something father, a music fan in his own right, absolutely loves the Decemberists. Now you know where I get those genes from. As I mentioned, Justin Townes Earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar, it should. His father is the iconic Steve Earle (another one of my favorites). Justin gets his middle name Townes, from Townes Van Zandt, of whom Steve Earle was a great friend. Justin Townes Earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer, only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father.',\n",

I had a lower back problem for several years and his sessions helped reduce my pain and eventually make it go away completely. He excels at finding the tense places in the neck shoulders and hips and releasing them. He's a great sports massage therapist, and knows deep tissue, trigger point, and cranial sacral techniques. The combined styles he uses works better than any one massage technique I've tried in the past.  He's very flexible with scheduling, and works late nights so when I can't make it in the evening I can usually get my massage at night. Though he does out calls, I always went to him because he has a spa next to the massage room that I can relax in and warm up before he works on me, which makes the massage much more effective and gives quicker results.\",\n",

       " 'I got to do the ordering tonight... and it was a fabulous meal at CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe! I have never seen a restaurant that is so eclectic... you have traditional noodle dishes, both hot and cold, from Japan, along with Sushi; pasta dishes from Italy, and some items from SouthEast Asia! There is more than enough diversity in their menu to satisfy the most discriminating palate. Despite their diversity, CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe does not stray from the basic tenant of Japanese Cuisine: food items are never too salty or too sweet, and are never bland; you can call it cooking subtlety.For starters I ordered a California Summer Roll (Vietnamese) for my friend and myself. Unlike the Vietnamese Summer Roll spiced with mint, and usually accompanied by a lime dipping sauce; CherryBlossom\\'s version was accompanied by a sauce comprised of sweet Sesame Seed  Soy Sauce dip. A Summer Roll contents include Shrimp, Rice Vermicelli, Crab strips, and Cabbage wrapped with a thin Rice Paper \"tortilla\". Anyone used to the Vietnamese version will see CherryBlossom\\'s as probably a little bland... but you have to remember the philosophy behind Japanese cooking.My friend also had Miso Soup with his meal. Unlike the soup yesterday evening, he said the Miso Soup was very good.With every meal, you will also receive a bread basket ( http:cherryblossom-az.comcherry-bread.gif ). The basket contains three types of breads: a soft and warm French Roll; a slice from a dark and sweet Blueberry bread; and a crispy Butter Biscuit. There is enough variety in texture from all the breads to satisfy anyone.Main dishes...I ordered for my friend Grilled Orange Roughy. The Orange Roughy was grilled to perfection and was accompanied by a sweet and salty dipping sauce concoction. Sides consisted of Japanese sticky rice.I ordered for myself the Beef Nanban Soup with thin Soba (Wheat) Noodles, rather than the Udon Noodles, accompanied by a bowl of Japanese Sticky Rice. My friend does not drink, but I ordered the Rasperry Fruit Punch, a very good drink made from Raspberry Wine with Fruit Punch... essentially a Raspberry Wine Cooler (but stronger). This drink also had an umbrella \"thing\" spearing a whole strawberry! Very good and refreshing!I had my usual coffee after the meal which surprised me a little... an Amaretto laced coffee was brought out. The aroma was very enticing! Would make a coffee drinker out of anyone!100% of capacity, with 30% Asian; 20% Hispanic; rest Caucasian. First time I\\'ve been to a restaurant that was packed with NO seats left! A very popular spot!CherryBlossom is very heartily recommended so long as you remember the tenets of Japanese Cuisine... no extreme flavors... nothing will be extremely spicy, salty or sweet. This makes it easy to grab a little from this dish, and something from that dish without disrupting the flavor of either.There was something that was a little disconcerting, though... The state of the men\\'s room. For such a highly rated establishment, it seemed like no one had checked on the men\\'s room for about two to three hours... toilet paper thrown around, stains around the wash basin. Nothing really objectionable, but a little surprising considering the number of staff for such a small establishment. This establishment has to be aware that a restaurant is judged by it\\'s back-room as well as it\\'s front room. Won\\'t take anything off... but it is highly noticeable considering...And the diners of CherryBlossom has to share the same restrooms with Tokyo Express (right next door), both of the businesses are probably owned by the same management group. The interesting tidbit is that we both spent MORE for a worse meal last night at Bamboo House... AMAZING! My friend said his dishes from the Summer Roll to the Grilled Fish was some of the freshest tasting dishes he ever had; good compliment from him. In fact, he wanted to go back to CherryBlossom the next evening... but this is my last night here in the Phoenix area.... sigh....(I really think everyone is reviewing CherryBlossom under the wrong spelling.... It\\'s CherryBlossom, not \"Cherry Blossom\". Take a look at their sign or their website.)',\n",

       " \"Quite a number of the best meals in my life came courtesy of the fantastic chef and extremely cordial waitstaff at Blue. Whether for birthdays, work meetings, or just a desire for a nice night out Blue never disappointed, and they often outperformed even themselves on many occasions.The staff here is without a doubt one of the best trained in the city, from the waiters to the hostess to the managers and owners, everyone treats you with a high level of respect, and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the restaurant when you're there. After a few visits I found one waiter I liked even more than the others, and I would always request his table when I came, with no problem from the scheduler. Don't forget, if you bring your own wine (which I do quite frequently) make sure to pour some for your waiter! Not that you NEED to bring wine to Blue, because they have a wine list that is second to none (well, maybe Bonterra) in Charlotte.It's hard to recommend specific dishes at Blue, because I've had so many fantastic ones and they change very frequently with the seasons. It's a Mediterranean style of cuisine, so expect heavily herbed flavors on whatever you get, and an emphasis on great sauces. Perhaps my favorite meal here was a whole shank of Osso Bucco, served over fava beans and mashed sweet potatoes, with a crab and lobster risotto on the side. Pure decadence. If you see this dish on the menu it is the one thing I would suggest getting over anything else, as the meat is so fall-off-the-bone delicious it is nearly impossible to surpass. The duo of bison cuts is another one I would highly recommend.The cheese selection at Blue is also top-notch. There are usually 15-20 to choose from, including several expensive bleu cheeses, which are fortunately all the same price here. It comes with honeycomb and pecans on the side, and unlike many other restaurants doesn't cost extra. Another one of my favorite elements about this restaurant is the very first thing you get when you sit down, hearty bread and the most wonderful spread I've ever tasted. It's a kalamata olive based butter that looks a bit funky at first, but once you eat your first piece the bowl gets quickly emptied.Be sure to save plenty of room for desert as well (Blue's dinner portions can be quite dramatically large) because they whip up some of the fanciest creations you can find in the Charlotte area. And for those of you that don't go for overly sweet temptations there is also a huge fresh berry desert with homemade ice cream, one of my favorites!\",\n",

It cost something like 30 cents... Places like this pretty much do not exist anymore, the shop is like a museum of bicycle parts (and the upper stories of the building are reportedly just as full).

The owners are good friends of my family, from back when we lived in Pittsburgh.  I remember when they were first starting out--my dad helped design and build the sushi counter, and my mom made the original cushions and server uniforms.  One time, I had an epic wasabi-eating contest with the owner's son.  On many a weekend as a kid I would go and stuff my face with all the sushi I could eat.

The structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house') is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match. These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.Where this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delaysThey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.There is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others.

Prices fair.The major problem was the food. We ordered chicken and beef with shabu shabu and sukiyaki. Firstly, the sukiyaki and dipping sauces were way too salty and just not appealingly flavored. Secondly, the chicken was in chunks, not sliced, and had all sorts of cartilage and chewy bits. The chunks wouldn't cook because they were too thick.. The chicken was completely inappropriate and also tasted bad because it was served marinated in some sort of sauce that neither of us liked. I just couldn't eat the chicken at all. My companion ate it just so we wouldn't waste it, but he didn't like it either. The beef was ok, and sliced appropriately, and I ate that in the shabu shabu, but without a good dipping sauce was ultimately just disappointing. I like cabbage, but they served way too much of it and not nearly enough of the other vegetables or tofu or noodles.The minor problem was the hot pots. They were extremely shallow, and the waitress didn't pay attention to them, so they were constantly boiling down, and at multiple points were down to almost nothing, so we couldn't cook our food.I left hungry, and sad.\",\n",

I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!!!!I told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it.This brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant.

       " 'Okay, so my big beef here is not so much with this LOCATION of Bath and Body Works, but rather with Bath and Body Works as a company in general. Let me explain. For starters, I just want to say that this store is clean, well-presented and has some very nice girls working in it. The scents of candles and lotions are incredible, and they were hard to resist with their Fall displays front and center with names like \"Autumn Leaves\" and \"Cinnamon Pumpkin\". Their prices are reasonable and their gift items are very nice. (Sigh)...so here\\'s why I\\'ll never shop here again. I came in to check out the store and in my browsing around, grabbed a tester for a particular scent and gave it a try. I always like to do this with lotions and perfumes; before I commit to purchasing, I put it on and walk around with it for a few hours to let it soak in since it always smells different than when you first put it on. So I left the store and for the next hour could not stop smelling my hands - it was so good it was intoxicating. I don\\'t even remember which scent it was, but that\\'s not important anyway. An hour and a half later I was back in the store and heading for the counter, bottle in hand. So I\\'m reading the back. I\\'m trying to be ever so conscious about my purchases, especially beauty products, in that I only buy products that are paraben-free and NOT tested on animals. Call me uptight, but I just don\\'t think animals should be tortured so I can smell like fake juniper. I scan the label and see that it does contain parabens, but it smells so friggin good I make an exception. Then I see it: \"This finished product not tested on animals.\" And for a minute I think, Great! Ready to buy. And then...this...\"finished\" product  What the heck does that mean Normally if a product is not tested on animals it will just say \"Not tested on animals\", or \"We NEVER test our products on animals\", or the like. And if it says nothing, you always assume that they do test on animals. But \"This FINISHED product\" So, the final product that fills the bottle in my hand, the one that I intend to use, has not been tested on any animal. But what about everything before that And then I just got mad. Very mad. Do they think we are idiots Some big shot at BBW must believe that their customers are totally mindless, lazy, and can be easily fooled by the wording they chose. I don\\'t know what made me more mad; the fact that they do test on animals, or the fact that they take us all for idiots and try to play like they don\\'t run the tests. Either way, out of principle, I put the bottle back and decided I will never again give a dime of my money to BBW. Excuse the rant, but this just really pissed me off.',\n",

The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other I've eaten at.\",\n",

Apparently they teach different genres of dance every week, you need to check their website to see what they are offering for that week. They split off the beginners from the intermediateadvance dancers. Us beginners were put in a smaller dance room studio (to my releif, as I have never danced West Coast Swing, and was nervous to be in front of advanced students...)After an hour of class (which goes by very fast!) they have an open dance floor until midnight. Most of the people there are people who simply love dance. They switch up the music to a different genre for every song, i.e. waltz, foxtrot, salsa, rumba, swing...etc. Even if you are not a great dancer, or only know one genre of dance, it's certainly fun to watch everyone! There are some really good pros and amateurs, no one really cares what you look like out there, everyone is just there to dance! (There were people there of many age groups as well....from early 20's to 60's or 70's!)I love that you can just drop in for a class. No sign up or commitment necessary!

       " 'I now understand where the name comes from. Yesterday I went into Dick\\'s to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like \" missing manual or dead battery\" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. I get \"as is\" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.Now I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price.

Most important, the vibe here is unlike any dance club I've been to.  You're far more likely to see a Sid Vicious look-alike or a break dancing session form in the middle of the floor than you are to see a shoving match or a fight break out.  80's music has a way of draining the aggression from testosterone pumped drunkards.

I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while.Aesthetics:Initially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside.  However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back.I'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine.

She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good.Food:I ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap. The hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg. I ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu.My dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional. Her lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu.I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal.Now for the nasty part.I drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it.It was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea.Well... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea.  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices.There is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix. Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave.The Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha.

Obviously they must be eating the dog food they have been fed by others who rave about this place.Let\\'s start at the beginning, went for lunch, walked in, saw people at tables so waited to see if an employee would be directing us. NOPE!! nothing of the sorts, walked up to an outdoor menu over a entrance, again what do I do next People inside look at you but don\\'t ask to help you. We had our dog with us, so I asked my girlfriend to go in and see what she can find out. She walked to the counter and again no one would help. Can I order Then a person replied and pointed \"you start down there\" Okay great, were getting somewhere. She placed an order for a salad (pre-made crushed into a small container) a chicken salad sandwich and a lemonade. she came out and handed me the salad and drinks and said \\' let\\'s find a table, I have to go over to another area to wait for the sandwich\"  I sat down at a table with our dog outdoors next to  32nd street (This is a farm) and she went to get the sandwich.  OH the daymare has just started. After about 20 minutes, she sent me a text and said,\" I haven\\'t left you, still waiting\" This is Chicken Salad People!!! slap it on the bread add some lettuce and tomatoes and it\\'s ready to go. Here\\'s where it gets really good, several people who arrived after us are getting their food from the mystery window by the red umbrella. My girlfriend has now been standing there 30 minutes waiting, she taps on the window and asks \" is there a problem with the chicken salad.\"  \"I\\'ll check\"  the window closes and 10 minutes later the window opens revealing the sandwich.  Now I would say this is possibly a one off scenario except right before she received our sandwich another person who had been waiting said he was on 37 minutes, and then another person came up while she was receiving her sandwich and said \"how long does it take to get a tuna sandwich\" he had been waiting 30 minutes.We eat what I would say is ordinary fresh food, nothing to write home about, and because I found the concept of standing and waiting 40 minutes to get an average sandwich so ridiculous, I stopped back in to express myself and politely said  \"This is our first time here and your service was awful and we will never return\"Their response, exactly like the whole experience started.

Again, it\\'s adult-themed because he\\'s gay Ok... just not funny. Another low-point in the show was the improv skit, where they asked the audience for a topic and just went with it. The only word I can think of to express what happened is \"cringe-worthy.\" So, what did I expect from an adult puppet show Well, FUNNY jokes that I have not heard before, and weren\\'t funny just because they\\'re gross. I expected intelligent humor, maybe innuendo and some wit. I don\\'t mind cursing or sexual humor at all, just wanted it to not be so...lame.',\n",

That menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste, after the first two (2) courses, were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side.

Shame on me for not reading the reviews!Waiter: The waiter, like others reported on their reviews, was the owner. He was rude, impatient and not interested in providing a traditional service. My son is only tow years old, and ordering a whole meal would have been a waste. So, I politely asked if I could have an extra plate. Waiter was fast to add that he charges $5 for sharing a plate. The first time I heard of such foolish charge.  Our table was in an area where the waiter couldn't reach three of my guests, and we told him that we can pass things down to him. He got upset and made a snappy remark. Food:  The food was about average.  Most of us ordered the same dish, and we all had meat that were not cooked all the way. We mentioned it to him at the end of our meal just to bring it to his attention. All and all the experience was horrible, and I do t recommend this to anyone.\",\n",

The rest of Bob's friends were old and older and I did not manage to laugh once, except at the dude who was wearing a fishing hat that Bob Newhart probably owned. That same moron would not accept my two buck off coupon at the door claiming it was a special night. A bunch of amateur comedians at a 6pm show does not sound too special to me. Out of respect for a date, I had to wait until after the show to heckle this guy. His whole 15 minute act was asking the front row of people what they did and making fun of them, an act of a child. I felt much better when I heckled him in the hallway, asking him if he knew any jokes and he had no response.

Though, the true treasure exists in the upstairs apartment where Maria has cooking classes and serves a 6 course meal to parties of  8-10 most nights of the week. I heard about the private parties while at a food tour of Bloomfield. I knew I needed to get a reservation but, I had no idea how difficult that task would be. We scheduled a dinner in October for the first available Friday or Saturday which was 6 months later! That's right folks, 6 months in advance! The menu changes seasonally and is posted on the website. We ordered earlier in the week so that Maria had time to purchase the necessary items and prepare our meal. The menu would typically be the same for all 8 in the party but, Maria graciously offered to allow us to split the entrees into a meat and a non meat option to allow those who don't eat meat on Fridays during lent to have another option. When we arrived, we all enjoyed the appetizers in a sitting room at the front of the apartment. The appetizers themselves were a meal- meatballs, bread, shrimp, spinach pie, stuffed tomatoes and cheese with roasted peppers- all of which were incredible. Bring along your wine as Merante's is BYOB. The next course was soup which we were served in the formal dinning room which opened to the small kitchen where Maria cooks your meal. At first it was a little awkward sitting so close to the kitchen and Maria. Imagine having dinner at your grandmother's home with 7  of your closest friends. But, Maria did a great job of giving us our privacy. We hardly even noticed that she was there. After the soup came the pasta (homemade gnocchi anyone), then the entrees and vegetables, then the salad and last, the dessert. This was a meal fit for a king! The portions were huge! Luckily, Maria boxed up the leftovers making for an easy lunch the next day. If your lucky, you may even get to take home a little extra something such as extra sauce or a homemade truffle. Absolutely everything about this dinner was perfection. Everything (from the food to the service and hospitality) was done with the utmost care and concern to ensure a wonderful experience. I would literally come here every month if it were possible. Unfortunately, Maria is booked through the end of 2014! Not one day available in the next 8 months!

And you would be more than welcome to stay for lunch.There are also a number of books and brochures available that have been translated to English. Printed words only get you so far.

It was really nice because I had already started looking for something else, so great on the sales end on their part.There were 18 people in our class and we were in the demonstration kitchen.

I don't see how anybody could learn to dance there. The quality of instruction isn't close to other local studios I have been to. Of course maybe the instruction was better than I knew since it was almost impossible to see or hear the instructor and individual attention is out of the question. I gave them another try on a Thursday for a West Coast Swing lesson. The quality of instruction wasn't good, and we had distractions because other group lessons and privates were given in the same ballroom. They have other small ballrooms so there was little excuse to cram everybody into the main ballroom. I watched a private lesson and wasn't impressed by what I saw. Paragon is probably popular because of the dances after the lessons but the music wasn't for beginners. So, if you want to learn dancing go somewhere else, for meat markets do Paragon.

The \"ongoing\" repairs in the hallways were not touched during our (middle of the week) stay, so one must wonder about the urgency of those repairs.   The building we stayed in was not full.

The staff member behind the counter let me know that they have a few cardio machines in the Women's locker room and the rest were on the next floor.  I walked into the locker room just to check out the machines (imagining a treadmill next to the shower) and was SHOCKED.  And I really do mean I was floored.  The Women's locker room has to be about 2,000 sq ft!  It's enormous!  There is basically a Women's gym inside the locker room!  I fell in love.  Lockers, a Jacuzzi, showers, mirrors to get ready, hair dryers, a cardio room, changing rooms, weight machines, yoga mats, a tv, and more!  Holy crap, did I just die and go too gym-heaven!Needless to say I didn't actually make it out of the Women's locker room to see the rest of the building.  In my defense, I didn't really need to.

       " \"Tonight, I cheated on Eliana's with Guanaquito. I still feel a bit guilty, as I've been with Eliana's for years, but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way, how can you fault me If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too. Hubby and I got out of there for $24 (and that includes the extras I got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow!).\",\n",

Don't even bother with a group as it only makes the servers even more surly than normal and the food even slower to arrive.The last time I was there, I was with a group (bad idea, per my comment above).  Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild.  When the food came, every dish on the table was nuclear hot.  I can handle hot food, but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos.  When we mentioned this to our server, she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time.  She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (Duh!), but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food.  Therefore, the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency.  Frankly, any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of work.The concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great.  Sadly, Fate falls apart in its execution.It's a lot less flashy, but you get a consistent meal at China Chili where they also know how to regulate the heat in their food.  Apparently their chefs actually taste their dishes.\",\n",

Plus I\\'d heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I\\'d give it a whirl.The service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I\\'d sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No \"how\\'s it going\", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. The portions are extremely small - I\\'ve never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there\\'s a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan\\'s offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.The atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn\\'t hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn\\'t shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.The waitstaff saw what was happening and didn\\'t care at all. My waiter didn\\'t show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I\\'d requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busyOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don\\'t go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn\\'t care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.Jews, don\\'t go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they\\'re open. If 15 people means they\\'re \"busy\", can you imagine what it\\'ll be like on ChristmasThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan\\'s immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan\\'s parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan\\'s did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurantOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.',\n",

       " 'Everyone loves fun! At F1 Race Factory, fun is their focus. Safety is their MO. I came here in the fall of \\'06 for a work function. It was a team-building day, so while we did have to meet in a room and \"talk shop,\" the people at F1 made it very comfortable and easy. We met in their big room (with couches, high tables and ample space) for our meetings. Breaks were then infused with team fun. We actually got to split into groups and challenge each other - see who could be the fastest team to change 4 tires on a real (thought retired) race car. My team placed 2nd. It was great! We got to do a practice run, and then two real runs to let our lowest time qualify. F1 was sure to have snacks and beverages handy after (and before) in case we worked up an appetite during the day. Lunch was served here, too. Tasty hamburgers made to order. After our meetings, we got to go on the track. Beforehand, we sat through a brief safety video and explanation. Then we were fitted for helmets and shown to where the action happens. I was nervous. I had never driven a go-kart before, and these were suppose to be the fastest in-door go-karts in Arizona. Uhm, yeah. Let\\'s just say I had no idea what I was doing. Nobody explained the pedals to me, so I just assumed they ran like a car. I was right. I took off, not really knowing how many laps I had to do or where I was going. There were friendly guys out on the track to wave flags - for \"wreck\" ahead, slow down or even get out of the way of speed-devils behind ya. (I got the latter quite a bit.) At the very last of the race, somebody sped by me to place ahead of me. That means I placed last. That\\'s okay. It was my first time out there, and while I spun my car around once or twice - and ran into the sides several times - I was just happy to be alive! To make the race fun, F1 gave us awards for 1st, 2nd and 3rd. I won an award, too - for being the turtle on the track. That was funny. All in all, I had a great time. While I would probably not go to back to race, I\\'d go back to watch people race or hang out in the \"cafeteria\" area, playing arcade games or munching on food.

We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful.

My daughters are interested in learning guitar and piano.  My sons may take karate or any number of age appropriate classes.  There is a limited day care that I haven't used yet, but am excited about the potential.  The gym is small but has what you need for a pretty good work out.

       " \"I had a backache in my mid back that wasn't going away.  I couldn't take full breaths.  I had to hunch a little because sitting up or walking straight hurt.  My initial thought was that since I practice yoga, I can heal myself.  I tried downward dog, plow pose, donurasana, spinal twists.  I tried hanging upside down and everything.   We've all heard stories about chiropractic.  It seems people either love them or hate them.  This was my first visit to a chiropractor, and I am a fan.         Although this guy, Danny is new to the Phoenix valley, he has been practicing in another state for a while.  He seems like he is from the mid west.  He is calm and and exudes a casual friendliness.     The office was slow or he was ready for me.  He led me to a table right away.  He took a minute to feel around as we talked about my pain.  He said it was obviously T7 based on what I was feeling in my back and it was quite common.  He said could skip the X-ray, if I wanted, since I mentioned I was price sensitive.    It didn't take long.  He adjusted me and then gave a brief massage around the area stretching the muscles around it.  He said it was important to adjust the muscles around the problem area because muscles are what holds the bones in place.  The massage was great.  Danny seems to have a massage background.  When I stood up, the pain was already gone.  As I write this review it has been 4 days and the pain has stayed away.  I did 30 miles on my bike today.  I am back to normal.  What surprises me most is that this Danny at Clarity solved my problem in probably less than 15 minutes and I don't need to go back.   I am used to doctors wanting to follow up perpetually for anther $50 visit etc....this guy seems to know he cured me and that was his intention.  He seemed to know I'd be a one time visit, he saved me the X-ray expense, anyway.  That makes it five stars in my book!  Ole!\",\n",

       " \"Wendy C., how can you review a place that you've never been to I'm sure the Great Barrier Reef is worth a 5 star review, but I can't give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient (or any review for that matter). Anyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. I gave it a shot and I was impressed! First, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. The fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. The slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. Tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. The bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. Everything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.The service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.A little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. It's worth it though and I'll be back.\",\n",

       " \"I'm a big fan of all the Big Burrito restaurants I've tried (Eleven, Umi, Mad Mex & Casbah). I think Eleven is my favorite, but Casbah is a very close second. My most recent trip was with my wife on 11510. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream  cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). The grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. As far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. I tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful. Neither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. The bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it. Also, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive. I asked his opinion on the French Malbec and he gave me his honest opinion, which was negative.\",\n",

There is a small kitchenette stocked with coffee, tea, cold drinks and lite snacks. If we stayed longer I could see relaxing down there enjoying a glass of wine, playing a game or reading. There is a nice selection of wine available to purchase so you don't even have to go out. Our room was very nice. King sized bed, robes, our own deck with a great view of the sheep. The bathroom had a big Jacuzzi tub and a large duel-head shower. We enjoyed glasses of champagne on the deck before heading out to explore and hike around their land.

Then hung a pair of drapes and the other pair for another window in the same room wasn\\'t the length stated, then I called to have the right length sent. Oh sorry mam, they have been discontinued you will have to take down the pair you just hung and order something else and by the way it is going to cost you an additional $200 dollars. 4.5 mos. later I am still dealing with their screw ups. Ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack. A friend and I worked on this for 3 hours, it should have taken no more than 30 min. We could not get it together because it didn\\'t line up.

My favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu, though the others are good as well.  The atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-Homecoming dinner.  The service is attentive, providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner.

I am astounded at how this place stays in business. Red can be found in a decrepit strip mall behind a dunkin donuts next a equally miserable discount movie theater on Tropicana and Pecos. They used have a location up in summerlin but moved down there when they couldn\\'t pay the bills.To begin, the prices and policies are outrageous. Each hookah will average anywhere from $20-30 maybe more. This is pretty much double the price of most other lounges in town. For some reason, Red charges additional fees to mix flavors and its not cheap. Every additional flavor can tack another 2 bucks to each hookah. To accompany this overpriced hookah is of course overpriced drinks. And what weird drinks they have. Lounges like this that do no aspire to obtain a beer and wine license usually sell an assorments of drinks, teas, smoothies and the like. Red, however, feels compelled to offer non-alcoholic beers and non-alcoholic wines (yes they exisit). After seeing their drink selection, I wasn\\'t sure if I should laugh or cry.Now keep in mind, I don\\'t always mind paying more if its worth it, but this is definitely not the case at red. The hookah is absolutely dreadful. I don\\'t think my words could describe the disaster that they bring to your table. The hookahs take forever to start and when they do get going, they taste like burnt tobacco. If your favorite flavors are charcoal and ash this definitely the place for you. The biggest culprit behind this atrocious mess is the lounge\\'s insistence on using insta-light coals. They toss these coals on to the bowl and lock it under a metal funnel designed to contain the coal if the hookah falls over. On top that they actually demand an extra 5 bucks or so for a \"re-light.\" I was left speechless when I was actually asked to pay another 5 bucks for another coal.The atmosphere and lounge itself does nothing to redeem the hookahs here either. You will find CRT television sets displayed proudly around the lounge. I don\\'t know why they keep the relics around. The place would be actually somewhat attractive if they got rid of them and opened the place up a bit.

After asking around, I found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are NOT pre-made but the managerschefs say that so that they don't get overwhelmed with nit-picky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush.  My point:  the next time you want your Cubano with no mustard or extra sauce, don't believe the hype and make them customize it for you!

Really a steal in my opinion.The waiting staff worked as a great team so we didn't feel ignored even when our server was helping someone else as there were many other friendly staff checking on each other's clientele. I loved having sweet potato chips at the table to crunch on when we entered and the selection of bread from a wheeled up bread cart with selections such as freshly baked sourdough and olive bread.My starter was the octopus carpaccio which was fabulously laid out and accompanied with colourful pickled vegetables. The main was the ox cheek which was so delicate that no knife was necessary. Dessert was a chocolate pistachio souffle which was very creative and interesting.

       " \"Best strip club in Phoenix... no contest. Went here tonight after writing strip club reviews all day which sparked a debate among my friends - we decided to check it out since none of us had been here before. And why the fuck haven't we I'm pretty picky and I'll just say that every girl in here is good looking and has a good body. Even the least attractive girl here would be the best looking girl in most other clubs in town. Many of them are downright beautiful.Cover was 8 bucks, there wasn't a drink minimum (but drinks were as pricey as any other club) and dances were 10 bucks... VIP was 20 bucks and wasn't terribly private, but it was nice. My girlfriend got some good dances and we spent our 80 bucks so quick we had to make another run to the ATM before we had even been there an hour. The place has 3 stages and the girls have to rotate to all three which keeps them from being available for awhile and that's kind of a bummer. It's nice though because there's always something to look at. There are a LOT of girls here too, so you won't be sitting there forever waiting for someone to ask you if you want a dance. I was told that the management here was great too and most of the girls I talked to had worked at other clubs but found this one to be the best by far. This place is a little more laid back than other clubs... the girls don't go crazy with the pole dancing - guess when you're hot you don't have to. At first I thought they were just looking bored, but when they come around to chat they light up. This place is more about mingling than watching a show.Bourbon Street blows the doors off pretty much every club in town and even ones in Vegas. If you have the urge for flesh or out of town guests and just want a mellow time with some beautiful girls putting boobs in your face, definitely go here.\",\n",

As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like \" missing manual or dead battery\" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. I get \"as is\" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.Now I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price.

       " \"*For the barWhile looking for places to have Easter brunch, I saw the Sunnyledge appear several times in my searching. They no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday evening.Just getting off work, I came alone. The location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. The mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. The furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. The bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. Behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.I browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). I stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. It was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. Not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. Banker's Club is the gin of choice here, and Burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.I found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost A cool $9.It appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink.\",\n",

       " 'I was really excited the day after new years to get a bagel with my best friends I traveled all the way from Milwaukee to see. Upon arrival, the place was pretty busy with people who obviously frequented the establishment often. We don\\'t have many Bruegger\\'s in Wisconsin so it was my first time here and it was not an enjoyable experience to say the least.It began by me placing my order and asking for my sandwich without the tomato spread. The worker actually interrupted me mid sentence to ask which bagel. I politely stated my preference and moved along. The older gentlemen working the cash register asked what we got. I said what bagel and my boyfriend also asked for 2 hazelnut coffees. The cashier responded with, K..... I asked okay and he responds with, I need to know what size.... I shrugged it off and was like well whatever maybe he\\'s bummed to be working on new years.Then, when I get my bagel it has the tomato spread on it, which I politely asked for it without, yet was interrupted. The man literally says, \"Ma\\'am I don\\'t know what you actually ordered and TOMATO is different than TOMATO SPREAD. Like I\\'m sorry... WHAT! the sandwich comes with only one kind of tomato.. pretty sure that\\'s impossible to get confused with. I tried so hard to not say a big screw you too. He made a huge deal about the whole thing and if he wasn\\'t so rude when we were paying I probably would\\'ve shrugged it off. I had too much pride though.THEN, he comes up to me and says MA\\'AM just so you know you were over charged because you ordered incorrectly. You shouldn\\'t do that next time. K. Maybe if you took the time for decent customer service and realize we obviously have never been to a Bruegger\\'s.And to put this into perspective, I worked at a breakfast place last year on new years day and not once did I feel the need to be that rude to anyone. It sucks but it\\'s not my fault....',\n",

We only got offered one round of drinks, never asked if we wanted a second round.  We had to ask for our silverwarenapkins after our food came, and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal. All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something, she would immediately come back to their table, not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return). Aside from just being terrible, she was also unfriendly.  As for the food, all my friends seemed to enjoyappreciate their meals.  For about 8-10$, you get a huge sandwichburger and a side of fries.  Except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to me.As a vegetarian, it was entirely another matter for me.  Not wanting a \"veggie\" burger, I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedgeschips + vegetables off the appetizer menu.  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip. When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well, she said \"yeah, it should come with it\" as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says.  It wasn\\'t actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she \"offered\" to get them for me.  She disappears. Ten minutes later, my friends halfway through their meal, no vegetables in sight, but at least we have silverware and napkins now.  Five minutes later, she hears us loudly complaining, and says shes told the kitchen twice now.. yeah right. Another ten minutes later, we\\'re complaining real loud now, to ourselves because no staff member is in sight.  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes.  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm, at best. He returns, and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about: THREE 6-inch cuts of celery, and TWO 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot, completely RAW.  It took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me, and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation.  We immediately asked for a box and a discount. Yes, he discounted us 10% of our final bill, which I think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips, plus half of my beer.  The waitress brought it out as one check too, not asking if us 2 men and 2 women (obviously 2 couples), would have wanted the check split.The kicker: the sidewalk sign outside their door read \"Charlotte\\'s Finest\" ... Methinks not.',\n",

I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy.

I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food.

Delay and food preparations aside, what really sets me off is that I not only waited 45 min to receive my food (altogether the preparation time was well over 60min), I have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude. Maybe I am spoiled but in every P.F. Changs I have been so far, I have received a credit on the bill or a voucher if something is off.

The suite was ordered from the manufacturer, and arrived about ten days later. When I went to pick it up, I tried it on for any necessary alterations.  I was quoted an extra $115 to make it fit.  Now I understand all suits need some alterations, but this was major work needed.  I took the suit, to get some comparison quotes to fit it, which were cheaper.  I decided to return to the shop to see if the would work with me in coming to an arrangement since I was not happy with the way the experience was going.  A $200 suit, now was costing me $315, when i was under the impression that any alterations were included.  I expressed my displeasure with Margarita, who became very defensive.  I explained that I felt lead a stray in buying the suit since I tried the pants on in front of her and she knew how much alterations the would need.  I understand that alterations are time consuming and people aren't going to work for free.   I suggested a 50% discount and offered to pay $65, to meet me in the middle.  She did not accept this, and was unwilling to work with me at all in satisfying my displeasure.  She even had the attitude that it was some how my fault for not knowing how these things work.  I informed her that she wasn't really doing much to keep me business, and she stated that she had many happy customers and didn't need my return business.  CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SATISFACTION IS NOT A CONCERN FOR THIS STORE.  MARGARITA HAD NO INTEREST IN TRYING TO WIN MY REPEAT BUSINESS. ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY, YOU'RE OWN YOUR OWN. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS SHOP TO ANYONE!!!!\",\n",

She was very nice and offered me another dish but I declined. Then the owner came over and seemed pissed I complained about the food and then when she asked my wife why she did not want to take her calamari home she told her it was kinda bland but not to worry about it she got  even more pissed. Then the owner said \"well I brought you a cannolli I hope it is not to salty or bland for you\" and walked away. My wife and I where open mouthed, I will never return after being treated like that.

I have never had the combination of milk and sparkling water and it is surprisingly good!

We\\'ve been going there for years and we have never had a bad meal.  There are some dishes that we like better than others, but we have never had a sub-par dining experience.   The food is consistently good and the service is always excellent.My husband and I dined at PF Changs last night (Saturday night) and we brought another couple with us.  I made online reservations earlier in the day and had no trouble getting the time that I wanted (6:30).   When we arrived, the parking lot was expectedly full so we took advantage of the free valet parking.  The restaurant was very, very busy...there people waiting outside as well.  We arrived just after 6:30 and they had us seated within 5 minutes.  We started with drinks...Blue Moon for my husband, Asian Pear Mojito for me (Delicious!!!!), Bacardi & Coke and Red Wine for our friends.  For appertizers, we ordered Pork Dumplings and Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  When the runner brought the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, he made a comment that the 4 of us shouldn\\'t have to share just one dish...so a few minutes later he arrived with another dish (and more lettuce), on the house.  Very nice way to start off our meal!   To me, it\\'s those types of gestures that kicks PF Changs up a notch or two and we have had a handful of these types of gestures over the years.   The lettuce wraps were hot, fresh, flavorful, and delicious!  The Pork Dumplings were also very tasty!On to the entrees...Tuna Tataki Crisps for me.  They are so excellent!  Round, fried wonton as the vessel, topped with Seared Ahi Tuna topped with diced Ahi tuna, cucumber and scallions tossed in a citrus-sesame soy sauce.  The crisp wonton and the soft tasty tuna are perfect together!  Mongolian Beef for my husband.  This is the best Mongolian Beef that we have found to date.  The sauce is scrumptious, the meat is lean, tender and moist, and the scallions add a nice freshness to the dish.Our friends ordered Orange Peel Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles and they both loved their dishes!For the table to share...Garlic Noodles (my favorite).  I CRAVE these Noodles!  The menu describes this dish as \"Egg noodles tossed with garlic and chili pepper flakes\".  However, that description doesn\\'t do it justice.  The noodles are tender, the sauce is savory, but not too powerful and it has a touch of sweetness, and it\\'s topped with julienned cucumber and fresh Cilantro.  Outstanding served fresh, even better eaten cold (out of the fridge) the next day....if it makes it that long!   I\\'ve been known to order an extra to take to a cookout the next day.Pork Fried Rice (my husband\\'s favorite).  Everyone has their fried rice preferences.  For us, we don\\'t like sticky fried rice, we don\\'t like it over seasoned (over salty), and we don\\'t like too many veggies (especially the frozen peas and carrots that most take-out establishments like to use).  Chang\\'s Fried Rice is made with egg, julienne carrots, bean sprouts, sliced scallions, and just the right amount of soy sauce.  Perfect!We completed our meal with a couple of dessert minis...Tiramisu and Lemon Dream.  Both were tasty and just the right size following a big meal.  Excellent meal, once again.  We all left full, satisfied, and happy.  We will continue to dine to PF Changs over and over again.  Yes, we really love it that much.  The dishes may not be \"authentic\\', but there is something to be said for consistently delicious Asian-inspired food.  For us, PF Changs is the restaurant equivalent of a familiar and reliable friend.  We all have many acquaintances that we enjoy, but the reliable friends are few and far between.P.S.

Everytime I am in town I check out this club and they never disappoint. Last time I was here was September 1 and it was the Hawaiians  first night she was fantastic. One tip, if you are getting a hot dance in the main room you know the VIP will be hot. If the lap dance is not hot and you hope it gets hotter in VIP it won't.  Believe me on this.

We had the Cajun popcorn, which is fried crawfish that comes out partially covered in a remoulade sauce. Good, but on the salty side. Tell them to put the sauce on the side when you order so you can dip instead. The sauce took away from the dish and the ones that were smothered in the sauce remained on the place, uneaten. We each had a cup of seafood gumbo, There is no meat other than seafood in the gumbo (yay!) but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless.

Seriously That\\'s how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...\"oh that place they basically just fry eggs\".On top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler\\'s rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).In sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you\\'re going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read).',\n",

Cooked perfectly. Light, flaky, NOT greasy at all. Just a perfect sandwich all around. Get this, the combo plate was only $6.50. Seriously Awesome.When asked if I wanted hot sauce or mayo on the sandwich, I replied, \"both.\" BEST DECISION EVER! The hot sauce adds the necessary flavor to the mildly seasoned breading while the mayo provides the creaminess that a tartar sauce adds without the overwhelming tartar flavor. (Note: I\\'m not a big tartar sauce fan bc it hides the flavor of the fish).So, skip the fries. They\\'re just frozen potatoes that don\\'t taste like anything. I\\'m still giving Mandy\\'s 5 stars, because the sandwich was truly exceptional. And honestly, didn\\'t come for the fries. But ask them which sides are made on site. The onion rings and fried okra are probably good. PS-don\\'t worry about it being catfish. It\\'s seriously good.PPS-I grew up around a LOT of fish fries in Kentucky.

The smoked salmon was perfect with the creme fresh sauce and toasted baguettes on the side.

This was seriously the most amazing beef that I've ever had and I'm typically not a steak person. We ended up ordering a second helping of it since it was really that good!We finished off the night with a delectable Creme Brulee and it brought me back to my days living in France.

My boyfriend and I have been looking forward to our trip to Las Vegas for a long time, Pole Position being one of our top priorities.Unfortunately the faculty were less than friendly, especially the boys running the track area. There were 4 people ejected from my race for accidentally running into barriers. These cars are extremely powerful and fast, and for someone who has never driven one before, it is easy to get out of control. Being a beginner myself, I was the first person to crash, and was threatened to be ejected, and spoken to like I was a dumb child who had never driven a car before. This was demoralizing, not to mention, embarrassing, being that these boys yelling at me we're younger than myself.After my crash, I could hear the boys running the track area saying that their groups of racers were 'stupid' today. Listen boys, if you don't like your job, get a new one. I felt it would have helped to do a slow practice run around the track before each race, being that there are several accident prone areas that come up quickly to someone like me who has never raced the track before.My disappointment in Pole Position has caused me to recommend  NOT going there, and I, myself, my boyfriend, and our friend who went with us will not return either.\",\n",

I didn\\'t keep track of time, but probably after 20-30 minutes we get our appetizer, still no soup though and that\\'s supposed to come first.  Buser 1 delivers the appetizer but practically drops the dish on the table with a loud thud and immediately walks away. About 10-20 minutes later the other dishes started coming. The worst dish was the sizzling pepper steak. The thing about this dish is when it comes to your table, the steak is supposed to be sizzling in the metal tray. In our case, it came out at room temperature (meat and metal pan), so as you can expect, absolutely no sizzle.Sometime throughout the meal, we asked Buser 1 if we\\'re supposed to get soup. He responds by saying don\\'t ask him, ask the waiter. So we ask one of the waiters and he apologizes and says he\\'ll get us soup. About 10 minutes later, we still haven\\'t received the soup so we don\\'t really bother anymore. The waiter walks by and asks if we have received our soup yet, which we said not yet, and he could tell by the lack of soup bowls. He immediately gets someone (again) to bring out soup. This time, Buser 2, puts the bowl of soup down, not sure where his mind is at, but drops the soup spoon into the bowl and splashes all of us with soup, my mom suffering the most splash damage. He says sorry once, but for an incident like that, I think you should be more apologetic.After a few more dishes arrive, we ask for rice, which is not something that you should need to do yourself at a Chinese restaurant.Finally when we\\'re done eating, we ask Buser 1 for some to-go boxes. He goes and brings back boxes and before he walks away says \"Ask someone else to do it\".

Pork had a fatty texture, and the dish as a whole was okay though a bit bland.  The duck won ton soup was pretty good....Right until I got to the meat.  Almost every piece had either bones or bone chips in it.  I am not sure if that is a normal part of how it's made, but I have never experienced the like before and it was a put off.The experience over the phone and waiting was fair.  The place was packed due to being one of the rare places open Christmas night  and I understand the pressure of being a host or hostess in this situation, but I saw this girl loose her composure a few times in the 15 minutes I was there, once pretty majorly.With the bones, fatty flavor and other worries, I managed a few bites overall before my $20 meal went into the garbage disposal or trash.

       " 'Although I have attended Louie\\'s show in the past and loved it, the review below is based on my experience when I attended Marty Allen\\'s birthday show.  This review originally appeared on Vegas Posh, the online magazine that my husband and I maintain.Marty Allen is what classic comedy is all about: he\\'s funny without being offensive, charming, has spotless timing, and an arsenal of facial expressions that keep audiences laughing just as much as his jokes do.  When Allen celebrated his 90th birthday with an engagement at the Louie Anderson Theater at Palace Station, he proved to Las Vegas audiences that at 90, he\\'s just as funny as he\\'s ever been.Allen\\'s wife, Karon Kate Blackwell, started off the show by showcasing her vocal talent... the kind that you only find from entertainers who had to rely on their own talent and not on high-tech studio equipment.  Allen appeared before a cheering crowd, opening with a hilarious monologue before doing his first skit, the wine taster from Caesar\\'s Palace, an alcoholic whose wife is so ugly that \"her pictures hang themselves.\"Throughout Allen\\'s skits, Blackwell played the straight lady, but even the straight lady couldn\\'t help but laugh at many of his jokes.  The chemistry was undeniable and the two had trouble keeping straight faces throughout many of the skits, including the one that featured Allen as a doctor who had just written the book Everything You\\'ve Always Wanted to Know About Sex* *But Were Afraid to Ask Your Children.Between skits, Blackwell sings, dances, and plays piano.  Her performances included a high-energy rendition of \"Proud Mary\" and a deeply moving Beatles medley.Perhaps one of Allen\\'s funniest jokes was the story of an eight year old boy who goes to the store to purchase a box of Tampax.  When the clerk asks if he knows what they\\'re for, he responds \"Not really, but they\\'re for my four year old brother; we saw the commercials and they said if he bought these, he would be able to swim and ride a bike and he can\\'t do either.\"  Commenting on modern times, Allen delivered another hilarious line when he joked, \"You know times have changed when a man goes to the drug store and says (loudly) \\'I\\'ll take a box of condoms,\" (whispering with his mouth covered) \"... and a pack of cigarettes.\"Although Allen\\'s routines are classics and many of his characters originated decades ago, he keeps his act fresh and modern, appealing as much to audiences today as to audiences of the past, without succumbing to the trend of getting cheap laughs through vulgarity.  Audiences were undoubtedly left looking forward to Allen\\'s 91st birthday celebration.',\n",

I apologize for my quick review before but most of my write ups are about food, so I was just straight to the point.Sooooo, much history here, and more to be made.  Many bluegrass legends such as Doc Waston, Del McCourey, and Acoustic Syndicate.  Other genre\\'s such as Little Feet, Rusted Root, and even members of Crosby, Sills, and Nash have graced these doors.  Too many too mention.   There are many free shows quite often and its one of the biggest venues where you can still feel that intimate vibe from your favorite artists, IMO.  1000ish capacity I\\'d say.FIRST OF ALL:Don\\'t park in their parking lot unless your in a hurry, there are plenty of free spots up and down the sidestreets of the area.As soon as you walk up and see the marque, you know the place is legit.  Once you walk in the can see the side stage if open and a bar to your left, always filled with friendly faces.  There are plenty of good beers on tap($4 for a stone IPA being my favorite) at this cash only bar.For most larger shows, this side stage I speak of, is rarely noticed and the dance floor for it is open for you to watch the main stage in the next room over.  That is where the fun is.  There is normally a dance floor open up front with seating behind it, but when \"softer\", more singer songwriter type shows happen they pull out the seats for all.  Another option is the balcony upstairs(which is full of seats), is normally a great place to be, because many that don\\'t know the theater well don\\'t know about it, although it can get a little hot up there.  The VIP section may be worth it to you as having a waitress is nice, but you\\'ll pay a little more for the ticket.The place is nice, but the talent they pull is amazing, rarely if ever have I heard anything not at least listenable, and except for a couple free acts everything I\\'ve seen there has sounded great.

Jack assisted us in picking out the perfect shirts and ties, which we gifted to the groomsmen as our wedding gift. I don't think we could have picked out anything ourselves that would have worked as well as what he helped us find.Everyone looked great, and the best part was that they got to walk away from the wedding with a brand new suit, shirt, and tie for less than the price that they would have spent to rent a tux. And I've returned a tux many times after being a part of a wedding party - often not a fun thing to do the morning after before you catch a flight out of town.Jack has continued to be a great resource, alerting me to sales and helping me pick out what's best for my business attire even after wedding. I used to be a solely Brooks Brothers guy when it comes to dress shirts, mainly because I travel a lot and value the non-iron shirts that BB offers (I HATE ironing shirts). But Jack introduced me to lines that Men's Wearhouse carries and the non-iron shirts there are just as good if not better than those at Brooks Brothers. Though a bit pricey at about $85-95shirt normally, Men's Wearhouse offers frequent 2 for 1 sales that make these shirts a bargain at $42-47.I can't speak about anyone other than Jack (he seems to always be there!), but I can't recommend him or this store highly enough.

When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.

We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.

He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big BurritoSousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly'This is about as old world barloungerestaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.Oh...but good food counts too. We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.\",\n",

Office with one or two doctors...I hate when there are a bunch of people in the waiting room( especially gross sick ones ugh!).3.  Friendly, staff that actually returns calls!4.  Doctor that doesn't make you feel rushed and listens to your issues!5.  Easy to access, not in a big building that is hard to park in.6.  Available appointments.Dr. Riley is all these things and more.  I'm  really happy with the ease and the great medical care.  His nurses are good with needles as well.  I had to get my blood taken and a few shots and she performed like a pro with confidence!So, if you are in need of a new Doctor I highly recommend Dr. Riley.  I think they also take most insurances as well!\",\n",

We need more places like this in America!My boyfriends parents wanted a gift card from here for Christmas, so we made a stop while we were in town yesterday.As mentioned previously, IT'S AMAZING.I'm a vegetarian, so the meat has no appeal to me, but they had a ton of sausages, sliced meats, and even fish! Their selection of cheese was also quite impressive. What really was cool to me was the massive amounts of chocolate and European bakery mixes! I had a hard time picking out what I wanted, until I saw a box full of chocolate with a picture of kittens on it, and it was called Katzenzungen! Its so fun just to say! Although, I looked it up on the internet and the chocolates are supposed to look like cat tongues...which is kinda weird but still super awesome at the same time!I will for sure stop in and visit Bavaria the next time I am in Madison!\",\n",
       " 'My husband and I went to visit my nephew at Carnegie Mellon.  It was our first time in Pittsburgh, so we wanted something close to him.  The Shadyside Inn was PERFECT for our stay.  We are very, very, well traveled, and are extremely selective about where we stay.  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that we will be staying here again the next time we come back.  In fact we tried, but the dates we wanted were completely sold out :-(The location is perfect, and only a 5 minute walk from the shops and restaurants on Walnut Street.  You don\\'t even need a car.  The Inn is a series of nicely renovated apartment buildings, so they are all equipped with well-stocked kitchens (my husband is a chef so he was very impressed by that).  The front desk person was sweet and friendly.  Not only did he check us in immediately, he gave us a \"breakfast bag\" full of muffins, juices, and granola bars!  Then he told us that he upgraded us to a suite, even tho we only booked a studio.   Well, when we got into our room, not only was it a suite, but it was a 2 BR suite!  I couldn\\'t believe it.  It was bigger than our apartment back home.  Right then and there I wished we were staying longer - like a month!The suite had a giant flat screen TV, a big dining area, with room service menu, free wi-fi, and super comfy furniture.  The bed was to die for.  The only thing that didn\\'t go was the older, un-renovated bathroom tiles & fixtures, but it really didn\\'t bother us at all, because the shower water pressure was great.  There is ample parking out back, and the service people out taking care of the gardens and rooms were friendly and courteous.When we checked out, they were renovating the main office, so it\\'s nice to see that they are constantly striving to update and improve.  Checkout took less than 30 seconds.  I handed her my key, and they told me they would email me a copy of my bill, since I used my credit card to book.  Everything went so smoothly, and the staff was so wonderful.  We LOVED our stay here and would come back in a heartbeat!',\n",

We came in to buy Italian sausage and pepperoni, but we were hard pressed not to leave with more.  They sliced the pepperoni nice and thin exactly the way we wanted it and gave us a big giant string of weiners, which I found hysterical.  We opened the wrapped up pepperoni in the car and we had a really difficult time restraining ourselves from eating the whole thing.Bottom line, if you want the freshest most delicious locally made sausages and other stuff like that you HAVE to go to Schreiners.',\n",

We stumbled upon a statute of a beheaded Lenin, signaling the entrance to the Red Square, which didn't open until 4 PM.  Once 4 arrived, we were the first to walk into the bar that day, taking seats at the bar, which is made out of ice.  Since this is a Russian-themed bar, they stock a wide assortment of vodkas.  On their menu, they had pages and pages of specialty vodka drinks.  We decided to each order different drinks so that we could sample each others.  Since there were only a few other patrons, we learned about the history of the place.  When the bar first opened, the bar generated a lot of controversy with the Russian community because of the statute of Lenin -- head attached -- and the perceived romantacizing of Communism.  The bar caved -- or maybe it was really a great publicity ploy -- and decided to behead Lenin in a public ceremony.  The head now resides inside a block of ice in the vodka locker, a walk-in, sub-zero freezer that stores premium vodka for their clients; it's so cold that before you enter, you need to don a thick, russian like fur coat and hat.  We toured the locker, knocked back a shot of vodka, and read the names of those who rented shelf space inside the locker.  For several thousand dollars a year, one can rent a space, store any vodka you please, have a name plate, and enter the locker any time you please.  Not a bad deal if split among the three of usWe continued to order drinks off the menu until we knocked back every single drink on the menu.  We looked around.  Just as we entered the bar as their first patrons, we exited as their last.  It was 4 AM.\",\n",

I should have waited for the doctor who I was referred to in the ER to have an opening but I was in a ton of pain and wanted to have the surgery as soon as possible.

I couldn't understand why after the deposit and my insurance company pitching in he was still expecting me to pay almost $800! With the ER bills leading up to the surgery taxing our finances as well you can imagine I was not thrilled. My husband tried calling the office at least three times to get the scoop on the bill. When it came in the mail it looked sketchy with no actual descriptive information on it. I could have designed a more legitimate looking invoice on my own computer!

This dojo is deliberate in creating a balance between kata, kumite (sparring), and basics.  It is also set as a traditional Japanese dojo teaching Wado Ryu Karate.  This is not a cut-throat plaza mall dojo, like the Cobra Kai in \"Karate Kid\", that teaches students to harm each other and fight as a primary resource to resolving a physical confrontation.  If you are looking for a fight club, look elsewhere.That being said, my son specializes in fighting here and does very well.  He has participated in over 30 tournaments in AZ, CA, UT, CO, and NV.  He has won several of these, and usually medals at every event. He is part of a competition team that takes extra time to train in fighting and competing.

One thing I will add is that the drills in the first two days are applicable to both the rest of the course and street driving so, they are definitely worth the time spent on them.From my experience with the heat on the track, don't hesitate to take a break when you need one, there is plenty of seat time in the course!From the moment you walk in until the moment you leave, everyone is professional and relaxed to make sure you have a good time and learn all you can.

       " \"Ungood!!! I went in for a follow up brow wax; 1st one wShar was ok. No big complaints, no rave reviews. My 2nd encounter wShar was a brow clean-up & then I got talked into a facial... Bad Move!!!Shar was pretty condescending & didn't particularly provide a relaxing atmosphere. But the worst was my facial was interrupted by the front desk girl. Shar excused herself, came back a few minutes later (very apologetically) telling me all the supplies were in the room we were in. She gathered a few things, continued to apologize & assured me she'd be right back.  Ten mins later, the front desk girl came in to offer me water & apologize for Shar's absence; she also assured me Shar would be back within two minutes. Fifteen minutes after that, with no sign of Shar returning, I gathered my things & left.  I was clear that I would not be paying for a facial that was not complete & the front desk girl was apologetic & polite. She also offered me a free facial the next time I came in. I politely informed her that I would NEVER be coming back. Bottom line... go elsewhere!!!\",\n",

It's truly an amazing house.   Walking around the place, you can really start to feel as if you've gone back in time.  I only saw one guest room, but it was impressive.  very well appointed with antique furniture, it had a separate sitting room with its own couch, and the views were of the thick stand of trees to the east and south of the house.I also really liked the enclosure of live australian finches downstairs.  They're colorful, lively things to watch, and I was told that sometimes the cat they keep around the house just sits around staring at the birds.Anyway, if you've got guest coming from out of town who are into antique and ornate surroundings, they would do well to stay at the Morehead Inn.\",\n",

I had asked for a large portion but he indicated that it was quite big, forming  a ball. Too bad this ball was pretty much full of air as the greens had no extras - cucumber, onion, tomato... JUST GREENS.While our table was split into 2 groups of 6, the consistency of service was terrible. Table 1 got appies, and approximately 5 minutes after, table 2's main course had come out.... which is understandable because they must've been super hungry (probably after 9). As we were finish our appies, our server said that he didn't want to rush us and asked if we would like our main courses to be put in. We were so hungry - of course yes. We thought he was going to bring out our main courses.... but NO. he had not even punched the order into the kitchen yet! ......... it was probably another 40 minutes before Table 1's mains came out, and by then Table 2 is already eating dessert. We were so hungry to the point that we were not even hungry anymore. When we called the waiter over, he looked so nervous and had no answers for us as he hurried back into the kitchen in the hopes to get us something to eat.. let me say that all our food options were either raw, rare, or lightly seared. Not sure what took so long.The mains came out probably 10:30. We were not hungry anymore. My salmon tartare with avocado and lemon oil was sub par. It was 2 3 avocado puree and the lemon oil tasted like water. Although other people thought the food was good, I could have really had a good meal elsewhere without the wait time.Not going to write anymore. There's nothing more to say.

I loved going to the Spiritual Warrior classes. The community service they do is very admireable. I've seen them on Fox 11 news and doing lion dances during Chinese New Year, they have been to clubs to ward off the evil spirits and promote prosperity and health.

It was hard to find a machine. The staff also didn't really enforce the 30 min time-limit policy, which caused people to have to wait for equipment longer than necessary.I was told on the phone I needed to let them know before the 25th of a given month to cancel my membership moving forward (and not be charged for the next month). I wasn't told that I had to give 30 days notice (aka pay for an extra month).

One of my good friends works there (idk if he still does, but he worked there FOREVER).  I was immediately hooked on climbing! AZR is a great place for kid parties and team building (they probably have at least one kid birthday party every weekend).  They have plenty of bouldering and trad routes for people of all skill levels. They even have lead climbing (and classes to teach you lead climbing if you don't know how...which I don't haha).

I ordered a chicken sandwich, a large cevapi (which I can only think means \"delicious spicy meat fingers\" in Bosnian) sandwich, a cheese pita, and a spinach pita.  I can\\'t really put my finger on what makes the food so good, other than it\\'s straight up comfort food that sticks to your ribs and makes you wish all pants came with elastic waistbands.The restaurant itself is out of this world; no seriously, it\\'s like walking into some small Bosnian hole-in-the-wall.  What it lacks in amenities it makes up in character; you\\'ve got soccer playing on the TV and this 70\\'s eastern European techno playing in the background while a bunch of men chat away in the back of the shop.  The best way to describe it is Star Wars Cantina scene meets National Geographic.  Don\\'t worry about feeling like an outsider, nobody pays attention to the confused and worried look on your face unless it\\'s the gracious and friendly host.  ;)Anyway, back to the food.  The chicken sandwich was perfectly seasoned and cooked, while the meaty Bosnian sausages put Jimmy Dean and his family to shame.  I recommend using the Kobayashi method on these dishes; meat first, bread second.  Oh, and don\\'t forget to ask for some ajvar (tart red-pepper sauce) to dress your sausages with.  The bread shouldn\\'t be ignored though since it is thick, rich, and hearty.  The pitas are not pitas in the Middle-EasternGreek sense, they\\'re more like stuffed fillo pies and they\\'re just as delicious as the rest of the entrees.  By the way, the portions are quite large and make a Hungry Man frozen dinner look (and taste) like a McD\\'s Happy Meal.  Actually, if McD could make their McNuggets even remotely taste like Sarajevo\\'s cevapi, they would rule the world.In all seriousness though, this is simply awesome comfort food at an uber affordable price.  Although I must admit that I was so in love with my plate that I may have snarled and showed my teeth to innocent bystanders who got too close.  Regardless, I definitely recommend this place if you want to try something (as Cheech and Chong would say) that\\'s the same as your favorite comfort food but different.

Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined.

I did have some doubt right before I got my brows done. My natural eyebrows were very thin and each were very different in shape, length, etc, and it's always been difficult to draw them on evenly. But, the assistant was very patient and helpful and spent probably half an hour making my eyebrows the shape I wanted them. Getting them tattooed: Min, having been doing this for so long, is confident in what she does, so she does move a little fast. But be assured, she knows exactly what she's doing. I told her I was still a little unsure of the shape of my right brow but she said not to worry, she would fix it, and she picked a color that would look good on me. Obviously when you're about to have something tattooed onto your face, you want to be 100% sure about everything before you start. I had a little doubt about the shape of the right brow and if the color was too dark, but I couldn't be more happy with the results. My brows look very natural and people are surprised when I tell them they're tattooed because of how subtle and natural they are. OVERALL: Would recommend! Experienced and friendly. Great prices.

I came from way out of town for an act that I couldn't pass up: the Corb Lund Band.  Canadian Honky-Tonk at its finest!  What I like most was the vibes - this place has character.  You can tell the building is old, but from what it looks like, it is in great condition.  The mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retro-modern twist.  I like it.  If it's open, try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony, especially if seats are limited down below.  The view and sound is fantastic.Ticket prices are right on the mark - most shows that I saw are under $20, most well below that.  Corb was $15, and from the performance we got, I'd say it was well worth it.  What also blew me away was the drink prices, I got an above rail whiskey mixer for under $5.  Maybe I'm not used to small town prices, but this was an unexpected surprise.All towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like The Highdive.

Every year their line-up changes and it always features an incredible variety of shows. I\\'ve seen a classics such as \"Antony and Cleopatra\" to the interesting (but potentially uncomfortable) \"In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play).\" My outright favorite evening with PICT was during a premiere of a play named \"Our Class,\" which was an incredibly shocking but important play about, sadly, real events: a WWII mass murder of the Jewish community living in a town in Poland. No one wanted to speak during or after that show, and the actors handled the roles and portrayal of both inhumane actions and traumatic events incredibly and impressively well. Kudos to them and all of PICT for tackling such an imposing but important project.I have plans to see at least one more if not two more PICT performances this year; not once have they disappointed me, and their contributions to the theater scene in this city are always outstanding.

My only regret is that I wasn't able to run around and frolic among the plants like a little kid.  I have to say my favorite greenhouses were probably 8 and 10.  8 had a ton of carnivorous plants and orchids (which are awesome) and 10 had an Amorphophallus Titanum, a plant that grows an absolutely gigantic flower. Unfortunately it is in the beginning stages of this years growth, but that's just an incentive to come back :)The rock hill garden was both visually stunning and a great place for children to play.  While I was there, a wedding was being held and children were running around having a wild time.  If you have kids, take them here, they will love it.

I did not have to put anything in it (I did add some cinnamon though).  It is fantastic!  Perfectly brewed to perfection.  I even bought a bag of beans of La Prima\\'s own Grow Pittsburgh brand bold flavor that they have made locally. It\\'s delicious!This is a really authentic Italian coffee shop attached to a bakery and a wonderful find right off \"The Strip\" in Downtown Pittsburgh.',\n",

       " \"If you are looking for a classic Catholic church in Phoenix, this is it. St. Mary's Basilica has a beautiful sounding choir, wonderful priests and a historically Catholic feel with architecture and structure. I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day. I've been going to St. Mary's Basilica for years. Ironically enough, Father Vince, who is a priest at St. Mary's Basilica, used to be the priest at St Isidore's in Danville, California which was the church I went to when I was growing up. During the holidays, I make sure I attend mass at St. Mary's Basilica. There's something about the architecture, music, and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times. However, it's also a great church for Sunday mass. Around 7 years ago, my sister married her husband at St Mary's Basilica  and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor. The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister, her husband, myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony. There isn't much more I can say about St. Mary's Basilica in this review, but I will end this by saying that each Mass is a different experience and it's based on the person attending, but be sure to visit this church and attend a Mass so see if it's right for you.\",\n",

Men far outnumbered women, but during the course of the lesson it almost evened out. Lot's of partner switching -- in fact switching is almost all we did. That has it's advantages if your main goal is to hold hands with lots of partners. I have certainly heard a lot of hype about Paragon but the studio left me kind of cold. I don't see how anybody could learn to dance there. The quality of instruction isn't close to other local studios I have been to. Of course maybe the instruction was better than I knew since it was almost impossible to see or hear the instructor and individual attention is out of the question. I gave them another try on a Thursday for a West Coast Swing lesson. The quality of instruction wasn't good, and we had distractions because other group lessons and privates were given in the same ballroom. They have other small ballrooms so there was little excuse to cram everybody into the main ballroom. I watched a private lesson and wasn't impressed by what I saw. Paragon is probably popular because of the dances after the lessons but the music wasn't for beginners. So, if you want to learn dancing go somewhere else, for meat markets do Paragon. Their prices and quality will appeal to anyone who thinks McDonald's is a great deal.\",\n",

       " 'I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel IHG brand  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee it is unavoidable in the center of the cityAt least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist I wish I remembered her name  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel and I truly believe it Our room was 15th floor room 1534  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows one side had a great view of uptown not the arena which is behind the hotel and the ceilings were over 12 feet high Our king bed was comfy as always and I always fall asleep quickly on themThe hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people  It is located one block from the Epicenter and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 35 miles to go to an auditorium we saw Wicked and it was fantastic  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown  In the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels  For anybody looking into hotels I suggest you sign up for their rewards system whether or be this one priority club or another chains version of it  Hotels reward loyalty and will do a lot to keep you loyal  We did our research and liked the IHG brand everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinentalfor a few reasons they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points and pricewise they stay competitive  Our room preferences are already saved to our account free to create  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs then stick to it  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year they will do a little more to keep you happy and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me at no additional cost  The room was only 97 and that really cant be beat  for this location',\n",

       " 'The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was originally a movie theater called The Stanley It was built in 1927 and was billed as Pittsburghs Palace of Amusement Its acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built 65 cents would not only buy you a photoplay but youd also get live entertainment too A two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the US Department of the Interior brought it back to its original condition The grand lobbys mirrors and woodwork are all original Of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater only one is a replica In fact the main chandelier weighs 4700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide The sightlines here are awesome It truly is a masterpiece of theater design Lets face it fellow Yelpers youre not here for my architectural reviews are you Okay I came here last night for the Decemberists concert featuring Justin Townes Earle as the opener There were only single seats left when I tried to get tickets So I ended up going by myself to the show Hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion The Portland OR based Decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their CD The King Is Dead has been doing quite well So much so that it reached 1 on the Billboard Charts in late January The Decemberists in the past have dabbled in socalled progressive rock and British folk but this new CD is definitely more of an AmericanaAlt Country sound So much so that the single Down by the Water reminds me of Firetowns The Good Life for some reason Firetown later evolved into Garbagein both senses of the word But thats another story So it was no surprise that after doing The Crane Wife Parts 13 Colin Meloy told the audience I dont know who wrote the set list but they thought we were a prog band Were not a prog band anymore Were a folk band Hmmm That actually was a pretty apt description Despite this they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue There was plenty of good singin and good playin though Sam Watkins of Nickel Creek played fiddle against Jenny Conlees accordion and they did a rousing Irish jig to the song Rox in the Box It was almost strange though how Meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song Rise to Me They also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show and face it folks you cant keep a good prog band down But anyway this show proved that the Decemberists arent some flash in the pan Their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that theyre in it for the long haul I should also mention that my 60something father a music fan in his own right absolutely loves the Decemberists Now you know where I get those genes from As I mentioned Justin Townes Earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar it should His father is the iconic Steve Earle another one of my favorites Justin gets his middle name Townes from Townes Van Zandt of whom Steve Earle was a great friend Justin Townes Earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father',\n",

flavor  The Stone House and the Stable Grill both offer really cool experiences be sure to take a walk through the cool tunnel that serves as a wine cellar and connects the twoI think Quiveys Grove is best enjoyed when youre planning to spend an hour or so at the bar waiting for a table preferably on one of those cold winter nights where its so brutal that you cant stand the walk from the car to the restaurant door  Quiveys practically exists to keep you warmBest sushi Ive had so far in Charlotte Make sure you try their Coastal Roll my husband and I were floored by the sushi quality and the priceWonderful restaurant and evening all aroundPauls is my favorite record shop in town As others have notedits not a big place but it is chock full of wellorganized stuff They have a wide variety of music and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly  They know about music not just one variety and theyve never been condescending or rude If they dont have something youre looking for in stock theyll gladly order it for you and they were very helpful when I was trying to find out whether an old jazz record had been reissued on CD If I cant buy my CDs straight from the band Pauls is where I goAlways 5 stars for Julie Shes the only one Ill let touch my hands and feet I followed her from Luxy nail salon its worth the extra 5 min to get my nails done Shes germafobic so I know Im safe The salon is really nice clean and quiet Im glad that she transferred its a way nicer placeShe is completely unprofessional First I take i contact her to do face painting for my daughters birthday party It takes her 3 days to get back to me Then during trying to nail down a time for her to come out She over books herself Its clear she isnt a true professional Nor is she proactive about her business I will NOT be using her and you may want to look else whereSour taste left in my mouth after my 6 yr old daughter drank expired milk that they had out for sale She didnt check the date but that shouldnt be her responsibility Im strongly upset after this experience so be wary if you decide to go and remember to check the datesOur favorite dining place to go as a family  Nakatos is our go to restaurant  We love the food and hot sake  Staff is friendly  Though we love all of the chefs we are partial to Carlos and Alan  David the manager is very friendly tooI love it here It is like walking into a little piece of history I could see the upper crusts socializing in here back in the day Furs and fedoras and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways This is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares I have not experienced large playhouses in other cities But my advice is pick a show you love a decent Broadway one splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable Spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience I dont think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view And unlike Heinz hall you have a little leg room There are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint The ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late Grrr that Pittsburgh parking speaking of parking I would park at the 9th and Penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can I appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions I think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other American cities has been left to decay Cue in Detroit sadly So props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going true Pittsburgh beautyEvery city needs a good record shop and thank god Charlottes got LunchboxI admit that I download more than I physically buy music these days but with Lunchbox so close Ive started buying CDs and records again  Every time Ive gone in theyve had exactly what I was looking for and the dudes manning the counter are always extremely helpfulThis awesome little independent gem is another reason Plaza Midwood is my favorite neighborhood in the Queen CityI loved this show It was my first time experiencing an intimate comedy show At the Palace Station venue we waited forever to get our tickets but Louie held off from starting until EVERYONE was squeezed in I cant believe he is still so talented after all of these years The best part is that you can tell he loved doing the show and that he loved his audienceAwesome little home decor shop in Pittsburg  We stumbled upon this place while exploring the city  I posted some pictures for you to check out  They have a great selection even though its not a massive store  People are friendly and well trained to help you find whatever you are looking forOne of the premier record stores in the entire country Totally amazing Not overpriced has a friendly staff who are there because theyre into music Jerry himself is still there most of the time even though I heard he was trying to retire Stores like this are the heart and soul of a citys music scene and I think that Pittsburgh never died as a record town partly because of this very place Any visit to Pittsburgh requires a visit to Jerrys and then to Pauls CDsWe came here to see the play You say Tomato I Say Shut Up and what fun we had The stage is visible from any seat the waitress was never too far and the food was satisfying We really had a great time and enjoyed watching a play while eating and drinking Great time and we cant wait to come back for another showFANTASTIC  FYI This review only concerns the Puppet Slam for adultsSkip spending more money for a Harkins ticket and come see the hilariously entertaining and offbeat puppet show 8 dollars if you reserve them in advance Acts are all great some raunchy and dirty some a bit more indie with a social commentary vibe  Overall all really intricate and you can see the work and dedication put into the puppets and staging  Beautiful  Best part of all the puppet theatre is inside an old MORMON CHURCH so please drink a beer or five and watch frisky puppets telling vulgar jokes  That being said the facility is gorgeous lovely exterior and huge wooden castlelike doors opening into the theatre room I love that a place like this exists and is a great way to spend a spontaneous Friday nightIm sorry but as cool as Andy is I just dont like the sushi  The tuna tasted metallic and mealy definitely not fresh  I actually spit it out in my napkin upon first bite  The portions are large yes and the prices are good but Id rather pay a little more for sushi that is less suspectAerogelic Ballooning has always been one of my favorite ballooning companies in the Phoenix area  Ive previously worked for 2 separate broker companies partnering with Aerogelic Ballooning and our customers consistently gave great reviews and never a complaint for this hot air balloon company  I would highly recommend Aerogelic Ballooning to my friends family and even my current boss who lives in Glibert  He may actually be getting an Aerogelic Ballooning Gift Certificate from me this year for Christmas  Compared to other hot air balloon companies that operate in the Phoenix area Aerogelic offers a very personable experience  With smaller baskets than some of their competition Aerogelics balloon rides provide great visibility and tons of fun  I had the pleasure of meeting up with Aerogelics owner in Albuquerque where he invited me to dine with his family and crew over breakfast after a morning flight  The crew is loyal knowledgeable and always strive for the best customer experience that can be providedOk Im writing this review after going to this place about 4 times It is conveniently located near my house so having just moved here I thought id give it a shot since my regular nail place was in Tempe Marketplace and I felt lazy to go there that day First time I got a pedi and full set and had no issues I did notice the quality was lower than the job they had done at my other place but I was ok with it That particular day they were busy and I think her son and bf were both helping out Its a family business which I think is great Second time was a fill and pedi She seemed to be n a rush and my nails were all sloppy and the clear coat wasnt covering the whole nail some nails werent even and  just a sloppy job She asked me who had done my nails I told her she had the ownerThird time I went in Same thing The girl doing my pedi n French tip couldnt get it right They were all uneven and almost looked like they used whiteout for the tips Messy When the owner started doing my nails she noticed I kept looking at my toes and she offered to take a look after my nails were done Well Again she saw the sloppy work from the previous time and AGAIN asked me who had done my nails I told her it was her  She finished and again Same thing Nails not even Clear coat not covering entire nail and bumps all over I hate complaining so I just asked she looked at my toes which she did and had the girl redo them I felt bad I came back a couple days later cause I broke a nail and I mentioned to her about the clear coat and I showed her And she fixed it She also fixed my broke nail and it looked weird cause she did it again like always in a hurry and it was not as wide as the other nails Whatever I left I went back yesterday 111813 and she meets me at door saying oh we too busy its only three of them working And I was like ok sounded like she was telling me to go I said its ok I can wait  Well I shouldve left I decided to get my toenails red Thats how bad I didnt want the girl to try doing the French tip I never paint my toe nails red Ever Then the owner started looking at my nails and she AGAIN asked me who had done them cause they didnt look good and asked why that broken nail SHE had fixed wasnt as wide as the others I told her it was herself and she shut up She honestly seems to be very very lazy and ALWAYS ALWAYS in a hurry Im not the type of person that complains but I dont like telling u how to do your job either cause I dont like others telling me how to do mine But this time I had had it I asked her to fix several things And then she puts the clear coat And tells me to put my hands n the dryer thingy Once my nails were done I pull them out and she files the edges a bit And she damages one of the nails n the side taking off the clear coat I tell her and she said oh u did it when u out ur hand down SHE WAS STILL HOLDING MY HAND  And then I asked her about three other nails not fully covered with clear coat  She reapplied and after 2 mins n the dryer thing she said I was done I looked at my nails and she could see I was upset  Because she just reapplied clear on too of the other clear that wasnt even dry Theres bumps and u can see the ridges of the little brush  I was supposed to get my eyebrows done but i was scared she would just wax it all off So I told her never mind As Im paying she sees Im not happy cause I keep looking at my nails and she says U ok I fix for u I said dont worry about it I paid Left no tip and walked out I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but not anymoreHer work is very VERY VERY SLOPPY She is ALWAYS is a hurry and ALWAYS understaffed I would never recommend this place to anyone cause they will be very unhappy with her work I wished she had more pride n what she does Being n the customer service field I know that when Im with a customer Thats my only customer and I concentrate n them and only them To rush and have a bad product or service is just not good business If u go there be ready to wait at least 30 minutes before being seenPhoenixs best bar  Everyone is welcome Bored with the usual join the

come on downAll time favorite Japanese restaurant Hibachi shrimp is my fav Fried rice is the best  Never disappointsIf you have hair get your booty to Modern One of the worst things about moving is having to find a new stylist Before I moved to Charlotte I had my stylist do an allover color to bring me back to my original hair color and wipe out my years of highlights so I didnt have to find someone right away after moving for upkeep After a year and a half I finally decided to brave the daunting task of finding a new salon so I could be back to my blonde alter ego Girls in my office had been recommending Modern for months but I decided to take my chances elsewhere Bad choice After 3 subpar highlights I looked like a tiger in a bad orange and streaky kind of way and gave in to their insistence that I try Modern Man do I feel silly that I wasted so much time and money at other salons Sandy a stylist at Modern was not only one of the nicest people Ive ever met but she did an outstanding job on my hair She understood exactly what I relayed to her and went above and beyond in doing a deep conditioning treatment and explaining what we could do next time to make my hair look even better Sandy is a true professional and really listened to what I was saying about how my hair reacts to different things and they way I like it to look unlike the other places I had gone hence the tigerhead After a wonderful head massage during the deep conditioning treatment and a fantastic blowout i was on my way to face the world looking 100 better than when I walked in I would recommend Sandys services to anyone who wants to look fabulousThank you for changing my lifeAfter checking out other gyms throughout the valley it was clear that Ricos Martial Arts was where we wanted to be We chose Mr Rico not only for the martial arts aspect for teaching self defense but the leadership program he offers The lessons in life skills are nothing but superior Students are taught self defense respect self discipline and confidence Mr Rico is not only concerned about progress in his program he takes high interest in his students education  This was a very wise investment for us and we recommend it to everyone Stop by and watch one of the classes you will not be disappointed Although there is lots of fun to be had here the atmosphere of the show does not make up for the lack of cleanliness and overall ICK factor  I love me some dive bars but this one was a little too subterranean  That and please ladies when you are lip syncing at least know HALF of the words to the song  Just moving your mouth and jaw like an automaton is NOT fun or attractiveI was in town for a wedding this past weekend I forgot to pack my heavy duty equipment to style my hair and when I say heavy duty equipment I really mean it My hair is long thick and curly So I found Modern Salon just a few blocks away from my hotel When I first got there the lady that took care of me was very polite even after she realized that blowdrying my hair would take a lifetime She scurried of to speak to her supervisor or maybe a more experienced stylist for suggestions on what products or brushes to use Nikki came along and was extremely knowledgeable with my textured type of hair she had an amazing attitude not only to satisfy the customer but also towards the not so experienced stylist they are lucky to have her as a mentor I dont usually write reviews but after the experience I had at that salon I think its worth writing a review to mention the professionalism and the positive attitude of the salon I did mention to Nikki this is probably the first time Ive ever had anyone understand my hair She didnt take forever to blow dry my hair because she knew what she was doing I wish I could have taken her back home to DC but she suggested a really good stylist in this area This might be an odd review because I didnt actually go on a ride with them but I want to give them a positive shout out for solid customer service  Long story short I work in media as does my wife and we each did a story with them  They were very helpful and the customers I spoke with were very stoked on the ride and with them  Thats part one  I was SO impressed I bought a gift certificate with them for a present for my wife  We had bad luck such as super high winds cancelled and emergency surgery  cancelled then I had a job transfer out of the area  We were in a very unique situation and we were able to work it out and I just want to thank them  A solid group and businessif something goes awry I feel confident they will work with you  Thats itTo the owner I know your reviews have not been very good so here is what I am suggesting give me a free lap dances as long as it is not Suzy Q and I will write you a great review And I agree since I have only spent a half hour in your establishmentWe visited with a Groupon last Thursday We ordered the Hot and Sour Seafood Soup the black bean chicken szechuan beef and lamb with scallions The soup was awesome Very spicyThe rest of the food was awful It was tasteless the meat had a weird fluffy texture there was zero flavor It was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager He said the kitchen would make new dishes They brought three new entrees They were again completely flavorless but warmer I couldnt taste salt or pepper  or garlic or even feel any heat It was awful We paid and left yuck I used to go here as a child I remember the sushi was always good Maybe that is the thing to orderThis place should have a lot more reviews  but Im glad it doesnt they dont need to get any busierIts been there ages and looks it If youre all about ambiance dont bother If you pretend youre in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well The service is sometimes hit or miss Most of girls are good one is very slow one is amazing They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that youre happy Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen  busy times it can take a good while to get food The food is AWESOME Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there Once its on the table I forget them allFish SandwiichSalmon huge and deliciousFlounderShrimp a few ways Norfolk style is oily for my taste and I never had it growing up in NorfolkHawkins St SpecialPrime Rib sized for two watch itThe prices are low the portions are large and just about everything on the menu  is delicious Im not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food but if you like a good value and dont want to compromise on taste this place is a gemIve tried sushi at all of Pittsburghs sushi offerings and NONE of them can touch Little Tokyo Every city has a best sushi place and this is Pittsburghs Hands down Ive enjoyed over 20 meals at Little Tokyo and never once have I experienced bad sushi or bad serviceI am a sales associate for a company called Sleep America  I have an appreciation for sales techniques and I am a tough critic I was greeted immediately by a man named Alex Parsons with a smile He was dressed sharp and was very clean cut He asked a few qualifying questions which I appreciated I had brought in an expensive pair of shoes with me in hopes to find a belt to match He asked for the shoe and immediately found a great belt in my size He then asked if I would be interested in a pair of slacks to try it on with which was a seamless transition into an upsell much appreciated but the important thing to note he asked not told I said absolutely I would He pulled around 6 options and continued to explain the different materials as well as styles I decided on a flat front pair of pants made of whool great quality as well I asked for a shirt to complete my ensemble Unfortunately I have a difficult body frame and have a difficult time finding the correct fit and size He even went to the trouble of asking the tailor to take a look I felt like I was getting royal treatment and Alex spent a great amount of time with me answering all of my questions and meanwhile tidying up the store and giving me space I decided to purchase the slacks with a permanent crease and had them hem the slacks as well I was out the door with a new belt a pair of great slacks and shoe pollish to boot Thank you Alex for all of your great work I have already referred a coworker and he purchased two pairs of slacks and two shirts The Tempe Marketplace store is fantastic but more importantly Alex was fantastic I would prep him for a promotion if I was in management because he has all of the qualities of a manager If anyone is reading this and thinking of purchasing from this location call and ask for Alex He really suprised me because many of the reviews are soso He was unlike any other associate at nordstrom or macys which is where I usually get my clothing Call and set an appointment with him you wont regret itThanks again Alex DanesiFresh pasta sauce ravioli and bread  Nice joint but it is a market not a restaurant so you can impress someone at homeQuite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life noisy dirty poorly renovated and the WORST customer service known to man The way I was treated by the front desk was enough reason to never step foot within a mile radias of this place Doesnt even deserve one star in my book AVOID AT ALL COSTSI am a longtime customer of this spa but after it turned over to new management I have to say I will never be back  I got a gel mani that lasted LESS THAN 2 weeks  Before they used to last 3 weeks or longer  What a waste of money I have to say I miss the old staff but fortunately found them at another salonWorst effin Starbucks on the block and their baristas suck at making drinks Horrible customer service and they ALWAYS screw up our orders I just dont understand why theyre so lazy I understand their comprehension level is low because of the lack of education though But if you hate your job dont take it out on the loyal customers Your life sucks we get it but you have ONE job at Starbucks so do it right Its not hardI regret to say that I have walked past this store for four years and never went in Thats four years of gifts that I could have found in one place The books staionary gift wrap and kookyfun gifts are all instant inspiration They have way too many things to classify the store or its demographic but if you need something unique and have no idea of what it is just go in and look around Youll find itThis is the most wonderful church Ive ever been to The masses are beautiful and the people are friendly and welcoming  I cant imagine going anywhere elseWe went for a bachelor party for a friend Extremely sketchy but it was super cheap  Some of the dancers threatened to throw us out because my friend didnt give them 40 for a dance when we saw him hand them two 20s  Also when we were just sitting and smoking hookah and having a good time girls would come over and get angry at us for not getting a dance It was awkward and sketchy and ridiculous  Never againBased on Yelpers opinions tried to order some take out We did not like the food Period They couldnt even make simple food Rating of zero is not availableI was in town for a quick trip and needed a place to grab a late dinner  From the Yelp description I only knew it was a pizza place with good reviews  I didnt realize the atmosphere was so chill and modern  Pestos is not just a little hole in the wall with white walls and pizza sauce stains by the floorboards  Instead its a very nice spot to take a date or to just belly up to the bar solo as I didService was friendly and fast and a good selection of alcohol especially liquor is on handGreat atmosphere friendly service and delicious calzone Drenched in sauce and absolutely deliciousThis is the first and only korean bbq i have ever visited  that said i cant wait to bring my whole family here at the end of the month for my birthday  I had so much fun filling my plate with marinated treats and cooking them on my table  it was a really amazing and unique  dining experienceif this place sucks compared to the average korean bbq I cant wait to try an outstanding one But for now in Pittsburgh I dont know of anywhere else like it  and Im in loveIve got something of a love affair with this place Its becoming a regular part of my life now and I am okay with thatIn the past I would go here for lunch their freshly made sandwiches are absolutely delicious Given that I now work about 25 miles from here thats somewhat difficult So instead I now go here after my early morning South Mountain hikes Turns out their smoothies are quite fantastic as well I believe the general consensus amongst my friends and I has been heaven in our mouthsOn top of that their selection of local produce and related products is unrivaled Delicious fresh fruit of which theyre usually handing out samples local honey locally made salad dressings salsas jams and much much more make this place to die for I get all of my best fruit here without a doubtOne thing to note though is that you should bring cash here There is a small additional charge for paying with your credit card as its expensive for them to processHappy to live in a city with a club like thisCoffee and atmosphere are great but my God the cupcakes are the worst EVER  There is a bakery right beside them they should really consider selling the bakerys sweets or none at all  I think a fakedisplay cupcake would have been fresher and maybe even taste better  Yes it was that bad  Mr Manager try your stuff before you sell itI worked out here for about a month and a half when I was working in Charlotte  The locker rooms and the equipment are all very clean and you always have a fresh towel available to you  The staff that work here are super nice friendly and are always willing to lend a hand  I like this Y better than the other ones around Charlotte mostly because its not always super crowded and you almost never have to wait to use a machine  I really like the classes especially spin  I forgot her name but my lady she was pregnant at the time was always motivating and kept me going  Its a nice cozy little gym that is very convenient if you live within walking distance  Parking is readily available too if you arentIve been waiting to change from four stars to five and tonights dining experience did it  The staff always makes us feel like one of their family and tonight was no different  My eggplant parmesan was mouthwatering accompanied with their house Chianti  Friday night live jazz always a pleasure  Thanks Julie for noticing my hairyours was adorable as well  BTWthe place was packedyou may need a reservationI love it here It is like walking into a little piece of history I could see the upper crusts socializing in here back in the day Furs and fedoras and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways This is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares I have not experienced large playhouses in other cities But my advice is pick a show you love a decent Broadway one splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable Spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience I dont think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view And unlike Heinz hall you have a little leg room There are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint The ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late Grrr that Pittsburgh parking speaking of parking I would park at the 9th and Penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can I appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions I think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other American cities has been left to decay Cue in Detroit sadly So props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going true Pittsburgh beautyDisappointed Suzie was very rushed About 10 minutes into my appointment another girl walked in for her appointment Suzie sent her to go get her feet done in the meanwhile This is the worst my nails have lookedJust ate here for the first time today and it was awesome  Had the Catfish Sandwich and the best I have had since Chicago You need to eat hereLove this place Service is always excellent its usually the owner that waits on you The food is wonderfully flavorful without using a lot of spice Natural flavors are what makes this place tickIve eaten here many times and my recommendation is that you just order every appetizer on the menu and forget the entrees At least the first time you go anyway Youll want to try it allVery good foodI love this freaking machine  Its still alive and kickin for now at the MGM Grand near the buffet  We played several times and there was always a lively crowd surrounding this gameI love that you can play with ACTUAL quarters instead of this insert at least 1 crap that most of the other digitized 25 cent games are pulling now  Sutton C said it well  youll definitely develop a sense of camaraderie with the folks around the table with you as you all bet the odds playing it safe or putting it all on the highest stakes  I havent seen anyone make it big on this machine mostly everyone who plays seems to just fritter away their quarters slowly or break even in the end  Theres something so charming about the actual metal horsies under the glass running the course  And its exciting  any pair of them could win each time  Its impossible to tell at the start who will cross the finish first and if there is a pattern I couldnt pick up on it making this game a thrill every timeI hope it lasts a long long timeHome owners are free to use the facility  Its very clean compare to LVAC  The rec center include full basketball court outdoor swimming pool water slide for the kids pool table cardio section weight train section kitchen for you to rent out lobby is huge for family and friends to hang out even a library  I really think they did a fantastic job  HOA is not even high compare to other place  I am a Happy Home owner Good looking talent and really good food specials will always bring the customers into this place I will NOT return to this establishment again when in the area for businessThe cocktailfood service was the worst service in all of Phoenix If management knew how much money that was not spent because of this lousy service heads would most definitely rollSo I came on a Saturday night and this place was  amazing I have been to almost all of the clubs in old town and I have to say this is by far one of the bestI always go mainly to dance and this place was packed and everyone who was on the dance floor danced Sometimes people are mingling on the dance floor talking or only slightly putting effort in other words taking up prime space but people here actually danced It seems silly but this is amazing It encourages other people to do the same and gives a highly energetic vibe to this place Very attractive Like people just dont give a f and want to have a good time Thats exactly how I like itThe atmosphere was not only created by the enthusiastic crowd but the incredible lighting as well Ethereal is the best word for it  not too dark not too bright for the dance floor and then outside of the dance floor just bright enough and yet still somehow maintained very lowlighting Im not sure how they achieve this balance but Im pretty sure its magic The decor appearance and condition of this place is absolutely gorgeous The way it was designed is stunning like a Victoria Secrets model  glamorous sexy laced with elegance and bejeweled with luxury I also love the layout of this place Once you enter you hit the dance floor which is circular like Mayas those are the best between the people and setting it was the most comfortable dance floor I have ever danced on  people who just wanted to have fun danced were very attractive and chill You can then go around the dance floor to the bars to get a drink or continue all the way to the back to get a break from dancing Back there is an extremely nice lounge area where you can lay back relax and have a drink and chat I cant express how much I love this large lounge area in the back I adore it I adore it I adore it It has so much space room and comfortable seating with intimate couches and spinning chairs and its like a glamorous long break room or like another club all together Yes I love dancing but hell I need a break for water and a chat too The bathrooms are back there as well For those that need it theres also a long and large outdoor patio with seatingBy the dance floors there are actually platforms which you can stand on and dance on sometimes my friends and I dance on them Theyre really convenient when the actual dance floor gets too crowded and you can just hop on one of those But I do believe theyre actually for the gogo dancers that come on Wednesday night Oops owell haha Alright so I actually did not order a drink here or use the bathroom which are kind of my requirements for giving an honest to goodness complete review so Ill be back to update on drink prices and quality and whatnot Honestly I just danced the night away this visit and loved every second of it WILL BE BACK Love you Mint Oh yeah and the cover charge for men is 10 while women pay nada Woo Love it The lines were rather short I think I waited 10 minutes tops And the people at the front were very friendly and nice no attitude whatsoeverPossibly because of the cover charge there were more women than men  whoa rare I know and there was a variety of ethnicities so all in all great mix In addition to that it was the first time where I had seen more than 3 attractive guys at a club haha Lots of attractive people here men and women I dont know what it is but I guess a good looking and feeling club attracts good looking and feeling people How else could you explain it First and only club Ive seen so many good looking peopleIm coming back here asap Next weekend Doing this Every weekend If possible Sorry Maya Smashboxx and INTL but I found a better lover We can keep it an open relationship if youd like I dont mindSeveral friends and I came here during Arizona Restaurant week we made reservations arrived on time and planned on having a good time The place was halfempty and we didnt get service for water for atleast 10 minutes We wanted to order a bottle of wine but they ran out of the one we wantedit was only 6pm The waitress had a really hard time recommending another and the one she said was similar was rather icky Nothing like the wine we wanted that weve had before We werent able to order for atleast another 30minutes and werent served our first course for 30 minutes after that We didnt start to eat until we had been there for an hour at minimum In addition the blackberry creme brulee also suddenly became out of stock and we had to choose something else This was all during one of the best promotional weeks for this restaurant I would never come back here EverTotal Joke A place for kids to smoke Even if you just want to play pool you have to deal with all of the smoke and immature people For some reason a few people think hookah is cool but for each is their own This place can really be a great place if it was seriousGreat customer service  I was in Pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport  I found these guys on Yelp and the reviews were not wrong  It was easy to order the car and pickup was promptThe food was absolutely delicious But the service was even better Hats off to Debbie Service with a smile and great conversationIm not sure I can even give this place one star To be fair the room we had was clean and comfortable It did seem as if we had entered a time warp though Furnishings and bedding from the 70sif not 60s Ive seen this place rated up to 3 stars on some websites Id like to know their qualificationsWhen you first approach the hotel it looks closed down And write obviously it should be You enter through a side entrance with hand written signs Theoffice is a room right inside the doors The hallway looks a wreck Oh yeahtheyre under construction Dirt filth and stains everywhere Electrical wires exposed smoke detectors hanging down You look at all this and wonder how in the world are they passing codes Or are they HmmmmLike I saidthe room was betteralthough not without faults The lights over the bathroom sink did not work and the shower did not work well The tv was definitely a 1980s model Wireless internet What a joke When we reported the bathroom issues they said they would move us to another room Since we were only staying 2 nights we thought we would stay and just have maintenance look at it in the morning We were informed maintenance would not be in tomorrow Our everWe told the lady working the front desk that this hotel was pretty scary Her reply was  yeah we get that a lotWe had a series of misfortunate events take place from the moment we arrived all the way through to the time we left  Its actually quite sad because Id like to share the information but Id rather lick dog poop off the bottom of my shoe than waste another moment of my life on this place  Its awful and we wont be going back  The worst of our experience  Lets just say that the hotel employee who used his master access to open up our room while we were in it with the privacy sign on pretty much sealed the deal here  If anyones had theft problems this may be why  Hotel staff was quick to throw out sorry for each thing that went wrong but we strongly suspect nobody meant what they said I didnt want to give this place any stars but one star is needed to submit this reviewthis is my fav place in AZ to go i visit about 34 times a year and i usually visit postinola grande orange about 3 times minimum when i am therethis is the hotness everyday from 11am3pm every kind of wine is 5glasshello liquid lunchwell goodbye liquid lunch because youll want to eat everything on the menu from the bruschetta to start you cannot go there and not order the bruschetta  i usually get ricotta  dates  pistachios brie  apples mascarpone  prosciutto artichoke as for the main course for lunch the salads are great and the paninis are fin sweet as wellthe wine list is always good changing a little here and there afterwards go next store to la grande orange grocery and pick up some goods to go i almost forgot  its called Postino bc they converted the old Arcadia Post Office into a restaurant its got an indooroutdoor feel so you dont have to sit outside in order to feel like youve got a little breeze and sunshine there are also loungeycouch areas to sit and eatdrink if you want too instead of the traditional table  chairswhen visiting AZ dont miss this spot there is a lot of italian in AZ and this place gets lunch rightMy girlfriend and I went on 122714 and Louies show was amazing He hasnt lost his touch His opener Lou Magelowitz is always funny and has a solid jokes Ive gone to multiple comedy shows and this show hands down tops them Louie even took time to meet everyone take pictures and sign stuff after his show He is still all about the fans I will definitely come see him perform again Thank you Lou and Louie for helping make our year end with on a high noteStick to basics and this is the best place in or around the burgh  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter  Short order cooking at its best its like a floor show with the actors backs to you  Breakfast has no losers  Eggs omelets pancakes waffles breakfast sandwiches to order the ever popular mixed grill get a 12 Louie instead of home fries although they good as is and dont forget the italian toastFrequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason  As for ambiance well lets just say I dont think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint  But the coffees good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good andlocal with many long time folks working here  If I dont get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthyI used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair  Those two facts have nothing to do with each otherthe period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my supersenior year when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosiacaliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee and go back to school brighteyed and bushytailed for another day of class  And then usually Id take a threehour nap after the first class  But Im sorry what is it Im reviewing hereThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble Ive ever had  Im an accomplished vegan eater I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten Ive had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer  Believe you me Quiet Storm tops them all  I wish I knew their secret recipe but the part I do knowbaking the tofu rather than just sauteeing itmakes a tremendous difference  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning get the Nothin Fancy and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be  On top of that they are as veganfriendly as can be with earth balance for the toast soy rice and almond milks and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes  Plus sandwiches  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap ask for added tofu planks not crumble and be astonished yet againAND AND as a delicious cherry on top they have theme brunches fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is and make a point of going  Get there earlyAttended a private wedding reception on Saturday afternoonevening  BAD EXPERIENCE with the alcohol part  I dont know what was charged to the wedding couple but it was a ripoff  Money was given for open bar a limited amount and a certain amount was supposed to be held for the wedding party about 12  Lots of guests arrived before the wedding party and the bartenders had pretty much burned through the bar tab limit BEFORE the wedding party arrived  Brand drinks were cash bar and my wife and I have our preferences so I paid out of pocket for ALL of our drinks should have helped with the rest of the guestsBUT  Anyway the bar closed off the tab way too early I think they just doublebilled and ripped us off  At my arrival I ordered 2 drinks and was charged 1850 plus tip 45 minutes later I ordered two more OF THE SAME DRINKS CHARGE 19  45 minutes after after that I ordered the same 2 drinks AGAIN charge 2150 before tip Now howwhy did the price increase from 1850 to 2150 in the course of an hour and a half Unless it was a rip off  several complaints heard about weak or NO ALCOHOL mixed drinks at 9 apiece The dance floor was ok  The conversation nooks were good but I dont like to be taken advantage of  Complaining at a wedding reception makes you look like a jerk  Soooo Im telling you now I will never go there based on this first and last exposure to this  place  Youd think theyd try to impress folks at a special occasion like this so those of us might go back on our own  Instead why would I go EXPECTING to get screwedThis is the gem of University City Its laid back atmosphere hits you from the parking lot with acoustic sounds and the tinkling of laughter and wine glasses At least a dozen tables spill outside the doors filled with patrons and their cherished pets on any warm evening Its commonplace to have live music from the patio but doesnt overpower the conversations or keep the dogs from lounging The ambiance especially with the views of the lake and paddle boats allows you to shift your mind into thinking youre anywhere but a local hangout in the Piedmont of NC The Vault itself has tiny quarters but stocks some welltreasured and fresh names both in wine and brews Snacks are available with a varied assortment of cheeses pretzels and party mix Its very simple to walk in make your selections then take to the register for purchase The only problem you may find are long lines so I wouldnt wait until the last minute for a drink or the bathroom Its worth a drive from anywhere in the Charlotte area to see what the UCB has been keeping to itself This place is equally impressive for the intimate conversation of a first date relaxing with a group of friends after work or bringing your dog for some appreciative petting from strangers If youre single the last one is especially funLovely refreshing food though the menu gets a bit old Perfect unique salad dressing Must try itThis place is great My husband and I started brewing a few years ago and have never gone anywhere else The staff is friendly and knowledgeable Its a great place for beginners and people that have brewed for a while They offer kits and great recipes shared by those more inventiveOK so yeah i am goin there well actually i have all ready been there and back this is the place to be really it is no not for the drinks but for the view its all about the view and the best 10 dollars you will spend in a 3 minute time span i do not recommend going to the vip why you ask welll because for 10 bucks your still gonna get grinded on boobs in your face and prob walk out with a load in your shorts maybe even a hand up your shorts if you sit on the end against the wall and your a perv an wear super short shortsYep really There  all different styles of girls to choose from tattooed tits on a stick average beautiful girl next door beauty is all over the place Go take your girl then go home and do the dirtyI love Brennans You can always find great local food and produce here They put out lots of fun samples and the staff is always smiling and helpfulI am rating the food aspect of Cowboy Monkey 5 stars because you would be hardpressed to find a better plate of nachos anywhere For the Cowboy Nachos alone which are a bed of chips topped with tomatoes guacamole white cheese sauce jalapeno peppers and cilantro chicken optional I would swim across the ocean to let this savory swell of heaven crash against my taste buds The food here is excellent Though it is on the pricey side when the patio and kitchen are open during the warm months it is worth celebrating Sadly Cowboy Monkey does not serve their tasty TexMex fare during winter or early spring They open just in time for EbertFest at the end of April If you like Americanized Mexican food do yourself a favor and check this place outChina Grill Mgmt sold its stake in Red Square to Light Group because Mandalay Bay is having Light Group take over  a number of their restaurants in their restaurant row No more China Grill No more Red White  Blue And no more happy hours or specials particularly at Red SquareI loved Red Squares Cavihour a cheap happy hour cheap for the Strip where you got a 12 oz of american caviar with the fixins blinis creme fraische toast points shallots it was terrific for the price of 2 shots or cocktails of Russian vodka It was so much fun Cheesy yes but funBut tonight I found out the Cavihour is dead As are all happy hours previously run by China Grill Mgmt at Red SquareWe are very sad localsSo long live Cavihour We shall never return to Red SquareWe went in with a lot of expectations considering the great reviews on yelp  and we were starved  so we would liked the food if it even remotely good The place   the restaurant had a strong smell that was not pleasing to say the leastThe service  Bad they were running a vaccumm cleaner while we were having our mealTe food horrible  it had no taste  we ordered a noodle soup and a veg main course the noodle soup tasted like boiled water with noodlesIve been to Shanghai and I know this was neither authentic nor goodI never actually stayed here myself but I spent a day there for my friends wedding and reception  I thought that the place was perfect for the fairytale wedding my friend had always wanted  Including a balcony full of flower girls dropping rose petals on the bride and groom  The entire wedding and most of the reception took place outside in the very private very lush courtyard  I would have never believed that a place so beautiful could exist just behind the busy south side bar scene  Tucked away like a golden jewel for safekeeping  The owners were pleasant and completely accommodating  My friends had booked the entire hotel so we got to go in to all of the rooms I loved the feel of the place and would love to go back there again soon  Maybe even get married there someday who knowsI wanted a late night snack but also wanted boba so this place had what I wanted It was my FIRST TIME in cap locks for the owner to understand and I was a bit excited As soon as I walked in There was no greeting Customer service is a must for me So It was a bit awkward I didnt know where exactly to order Because the cashier was on the side but the menu was in the middle And I didnt see the cashier until later because a few people were blocking it It didnt seem like there was a line forming because everyone was just standing around In the meantime I was pretending to look at the menu but I already knew what I was going to order because I looked into this place before coming Anyways I ordered a large taro slush with boba Eight pieces of lobster balls and popcorn chickenMy boba was already done and made I thought they were going to call it out or put it out immediately like ALL the other boba and coffee places but no They put it on the side until my whole order was finished I waited a couple minutes more than five minutes actually Eventually I asked for it and it already melted I didnt ask for a milk tea I asked for a slush The company policy obviously needs changing The boba pearls are just the usual boba pearls And the taro is the usual taro The flavor is there But not enough to be like OMG It was OKAYAs for the eight lobster balls and the popcorn chicken It was way to salty for me It wouldve been great to be informed that you had an option for salt or no salt but then again IT WAS MY FIRST TIME So how would I even know it would be salty for my taste buds But I do admit that the crunch lasted a while I didnt think these snacks will get me full but the large drink filled me up so I couldnt eat the rest of the popcorn chicken and lobster balls It was OKAYOverall my whole experience It was OKAY This place is something to check out once Id probably come back again but after I felt like Ive been insulted by the owner and the employees looking miserable No waySeriously most DISGUSTING place ever had a hair in the dumpling of the dim sum one time which will be my ever last time to go there Talked to them with the hair the services took the one away and come back without an apologize or anything and walk away again What a nice service and the food made me so sick all day HAIR in a Dumpling EWWWW even the boss was on the services site and said well if she said no then it is no so that means me as a customer is laying how FUNNY11This place is AMAZING They welcome every human being There was no judgment just ACCEPTANCE There was no negativity just POSITIVITY I went in with apprehension I usually go by the philosophy take what you like and leave the restwhen I left I actually took 100 of my experience with me which included a smileI  have been doing business with Larry and his staff for many years  When I have questions his staff has always made sure I was comfortable with my decisions on new firearms and suppliesThanks Larry and the Hyatt TeamIve been going to fancy nails for years Jen and Johnny do an awesome job Timmy does the BEST PEDIS ever youll be hooked I highly recommend this place Not only are they good they are also reasonable Entire staff is knowledgeable and prompt Love love love this nail shopELVIS well the slot machines i love this place their machines pay out coins you can put coins in them as well i love the sound of cashing out and hearing the coins they have raffles every half houri always have a great time hereMy benchmark for reviews  Youre given the choice between the main house or the stable  the former caters to an older crowd the latter a younger one  Try the stable first  bigger menu more affordable prices  The food flavorgasminducing  The service friendly prompt and nonobtrusive  The setting interesting and relatively quiet  They make a nice drink too  On a Friday try the combo plate of fish and thank me later  Baconwrapped pork beef medallions meatloaf chicken Im already looking forward to returningI really want this place to be awesome because yet again I want Regent Square to be an up and coming area  This place has been here for years and as I sit drinking my bitter bitter coffee and smelling the overwhelming scent of I believe dog pee I wonder how its even possible  The three times Ive been here Im greeted as if Im a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them then duck out of the way  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them  If I didnt Im convinced that they would just sit there as if theyre not certain of what position they hold in this place or what the next step should even be  This is what I like to call The Dance of Shitty Customer Service  Today and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded and I figured the quiet would be a good thing  The girl at the counter was on the phone and thats the way it stayed for two minutes until I said excuse me  The charming reply Yeah She grudgingly got off the phone and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup I pumped this swill that Im currently drinkingShes currently muttering under her breath back in her corner  Im not sure if maybe shes having a bad day or shes just an asshole butif I had to bet Im going with assholeThis place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is and the foodJust dont eat the food  side note this place isnt quiet at all when somebody orders something  She stomps around like shes being sent to her room  Then continues mutteringOkay so this place is a travesty  Bad coffee bad odor bad lighting unbelievably bad grudging service  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place  As it is now its cornered the market in Regent Square and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of Braddock AvenueThis is one of those things you simply must see in Las Vegas  Of the free experiences on the Las Vegas Strip this is the bestThere are several songs that they rotate and the show takes place every 15 minutes during the day and into the evening  If you stay in one of The Bellagio rooms facing the fountain you can listen to the music on your television5 stars for being amazingTonight was the soft opening Great selection and fresh Good choice of broths and reasonable pricesI wanted to give Bourbon St 4 stars because I take issue with the perception of  perfection in pretty much ANY establishment but I could not think of any complaints about this place Also of the 5 AZ strip clubs I have been to this one is the best hands downMy observations Impressive selection of hot girls Interesting blend of music Super dark Good seating pretty much anywhere Three stages Popcorn Tasty drinks Friendly conciergetype staffThe best thing for a FEMALE client is the ladies room is IN THE STRIPPERS LOCKER ROOM So you get to see a lot of TA on the way For a people watcher like me this is priceless Probably my favorite part of going to Bourbon StBest brewer supply shop in Phoenix Staff is helpful and knowledgeable with all aspects of brewing They even do brew outs on the weekend with ASH that are pretty cool This place is great for everyone from never brewed before and just interested to prosI go here quite often to use their recipes or my own for brewing If I ever have a question or just want some input on something they never let me down Cant say enough about what they do and how they do itI love Dr Luster and his staff  They are friendly and professional  Dr Luster takes the time to address your back issues  He takes his time to give you excellent care  Thank youOne thing Pittsburgh is not known for but should be is turning old churches into businesses homes and even bars gasp  Most of the churches are so beautiful that its such a great use of space  This is no exception as its just so unique inside If youre looking for that nontraditional hotel thats NOT a Marriott or Hilton this is the place youll want to stay  Its fashioned like a European boutique hotel plus all the amenities youd be looking for like WiFi a shuttle and continental breakfast score Its also a really lovely place to have an event  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlors for a reasonable cost and youre able to bring in your own caterers  I really like this option because youre not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows  When its all dressed up for the event its just a stunning place for a magical affair The Northside of town where its located has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum The Mattress Factory Museum The Childrens Museum The National Aviary The Carnegie Science Center PNC Park home to the Pirates go bucks and Heinz Field home to the Stillerz as we call them in the burgh  Some are farther than others but theres always the shuttle if its in our frigid winter season  In the summer go for the walk so you can take in the sightsTheres also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard which is two streets up from the hotel  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul Ritas Italian Ice personal fave or The Priory Bakery for dessert  Theres also Legends North Shore not far on E North Ave about two streets up from E Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch   Its really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary  The big kayaking organization Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St Bridge next to PNC Park  Youre able to kayak around the three rivers for only 15 an hour  Its a great way to see the cityThis is your place for one unique stay I wouldnt steer you wrongLovely lady in green you have graced the sides of so many cups of coffee and tea  I have been unfaithful  I was lead astray by those Yelpers Ive been hangin with online and sweetheart let me tell you Im not going to stop  Today was just the firstI tried Boba for the first time today at Easy Life and wow is it good  I have read the reviews on Yelp for a few weeks now  Since this isnt too far from home I was going to stop before but Im always going tofrom somewhere and never did stopI got the coconut white tea with boba  This is absolutely delicious and Im still enjoying it as I write this review  I was such a babe in the woods I didnt realize I needed the large tube strawThe women working the counter were quite helpful and helped lead me as I strayed from my green ladyI will be back  This is such a great drink for a day like today that has temperatures above 100Thanks fellow Yelpers  And its all your fault that I was unfaithfulNot a huge selection but they have some really tremendous vintage pieces I got my 1956 Rosewood and black leather Herman Miller Eames Lounge  Ottoman in very good condition herefor 4k  That is remarkableOK Ill start with a disclaimer I absolutely adore the people that run this restaurant and have been going to their restaurant since I moved to Phoenix around 91 two locations agoHowever I have taken countless people to try the food from my native country and EVERYONE has LOVED it   From my vegetarian to foodie or chowhound friends have found something usually more that keeps them coming back Many thank me for having introduce them to this jewel of a restaurant My favorite is the Mojarra Frita becaus it brings back memories of growing up in beautiful El Salvador  I recommend the Especial Combinacion de Elianas for first time visitors  it has a Salvadorean tamale wrapped in banana leaf and is moist like a mousse the tradtional pupusa and a savory turnover called Pasteles 6  For a hearty meal the I recommend the Bistec beef  or Pollo chicken dishes that come with salad rice beans and Salvadorean tortillas 895After reading some of the reviews I just liked to say thank you for trying out this food but it is not Mexican food  I can recommend some of those if you msg meBravo Lucia di LammermoorIf you enjoy opera dont miss this wonderful performance put on by the Arizona Opera This was my first Lucia and it greatly surpassed my expectations It is definitely an opera I would enjoy again We are so fortunate to have this available to us here in Phoenix We flew out to LA to see La Boheme a few months ago and my wife and I both agreed that LA Opera doesnt have anything over the Arizona Opera Keep up the good work folksI have not much to review as of now but will update later as  I have just booked Quiveys for my wedding in August 2009 If anyone has had thier wedding here and would like to share with me photos I am planning the wedding long distance and it would be greatly appreciatedSo far I have talked with the business event manager 3 times and she was great each time I had a long list of questions before I put down a small deposit and she answered each oneWe waited in line which i thought showed a good sign that this Noooooodles Restaurant was good Boy was I WRONG Tired from all the activities in the Bellagio I was looking forward to a good meal I did not get it here The food was not great I wonder if I was eating a restaurant that didnt know they served bad food I wanted to take my food to go and give to a needy person on the street Never again even if i hit the big  in the casinoIve got to be honest I dont think Ive ever been as blown away by customer service as I was here I went in about half an hour before closing was not rushed at all I basically just walked in and said I was interested in a road bike but knew very little about them Im a MTBr I was helped by Glenn who within two minutes had me sitting on a bike measuring me and adjusting things and explaining the physics behind positioning and angles and the difference between the male and female physique on a road bike At no point did he try to upsell anything in fact he didnt even ask me about a budget He just gave me a few things to think about before I invest in something new He was very obviously focused on getting me the product that will give me the most efficiency and power for my needs So very impressedthis is absolutely where I will be buying my bikeIf youre looking for a superb doctor who has a wonderful bedside manner look no further than Dr Dena Cornelius She is one of the best most caring and thorough doctor Ive ever had  She truly cares about her patients making time to talk to you about all your concerns  I cant say enough about her and highly recommend herThe unfriendly atmosphere at The Harmony Bar is its biggest failing  At first I thought it was just sarcastic Soup Nazi humor but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees customers and even performers  Ive seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customersAlso its downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights jumping up on the stage and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the shows over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave  I was floored  It was the first time Id ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early  The kitchen staff works hard and the food is decent  Unfortunately this is the only bar Ive ever been to in Madison where Ive been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front  There are lots of other bars that also dont take credit cards but they still let you run a tab It made me wonder if they didnt trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor serviceIn short even on occasions when they book national acts its not worth going there if youre going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar  There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The HarmonySheila is a talented artist and very perfessional I would highly recommend her for an event  Great with kidsWhat a great face painter My sons birthday party was Pirate themed and not only did she do great pirate makeup but princesses too Ann was very professional arrived early set up and worked nonstop till the kids were all happy Everyone commented on how much fun the party was because of Fancy Faces I will definitely use them againLOVED LOVED LOVE THIS PLACE  Its kind of like a cafe style restaurant with a glass cheese display  The owner is a humble Republican State Senatorafter a few glasses of wine he probably gets cornered quite a bit  AnywayI was on a date  This is a GREAT date place  We ordered pairings of cheeses and wines that are already selected for you  We each got our own tastes 3 each  We shared each others cheese and wine  The service is so so but nothing to complain about really  After our cheese tasting I ordered the salmon  It was cooked very well with fresh vegetablesGreat placeand I look forward to my next visit in Phoenix to come back hereThis place is a craphole My friends and I have gone for a 2 AM breakfast a couple of times I know that seems weird but its cheaper than eating at the diner that caters the breakfast and the people working there are absolute dicks The girl at the front door acts like shes the hottest thing since sliced bread The girls that walk around are bithes unless youre throwing wads of money out I jokingly told one of the girls that my friend wanted a lap dance and within 5 minutes he came back really mad He said she danced and he handed her 30 and she said NO Its 60  Thats crazy considering the girls dont even look very good Maybe Im biased because Im not a strip club kind of guy but this place is a bad way to end a good nightLove this bar GREAT affordable food Awesome gambling promotions Free Slot Tournament on Sat night at 7 Bartenders are the bestIve gone to Rolliers a lot over the years whenever I needed a personal touch  something you cant get at places like Home Depot  Last week I went in with a busted window screen frame  I wanted to replace it and Rolliers has built replacement screens for me in the past  For some reason this time MT in plumbing was determined to repair my frame instead of sell me a new one  He told me that my frame hardware was actually thinner than what he had to sell and it wouldnt fit  Later I determined that not to be true  its the same size  He said instead he could put a brace across the frame  OK I said  Im always open to saving 50  Well that brace added at least 18 thickness to the frame  Now it wont fit  If he was concerned that a new frame would not fit why would he think this very thick brace would  I had to remove that brace to get the frame back on the window  So he wasted my time probably over 2 gallons of 4gallon gas and took 2567 from me   So much for the personal touch  I think I will stick for the impersonal honesty of Home Depot for now onI was very shocked to see that my review from yesterday had been hidden What is the point of this website if people cant write their opinion Obviously whoever is in charge of this restaurants yelp site didnt want people to see how POORLY my children and I were treated at this establishment A friend of mine and our 3 little boys two of them babies came into eat yesterday when a manager came to us and told us we needed to quiet it down It was quite ridiculous and offensive seeing that two of the children are ONE year Yes sir let me talk some sense into my baby and tell him that he is being rude I bring my children out to eat quite often and have never had this issue my kids are not in any way out of control or bratty Also a note to whomever this concerns in management in control of this site if you take my post down again I will continue to write this reviewAnn really knows how to make a party fun I was attending a party while I was in Vegas and the kids had so much fun getting their faces painted  She really knows how to work with kids I would have gotten tired but Ann seems to LOVE what she does and it showsThis place is so awful that I dont even want to spend too much time writing this reviewFood is mediocre service was extremely rude my catering order was never filled and when I called to confirm the order one hour prior to pickup they just simply told me they didnt make it and wasnt planning on doing ithuh  I once found a cooked cockroach in my dim sum dishthat was itwould never ever go backLove love love Champagne Brunch at NarcisseThe decor service and food is phenomenal and a few glasses of bubbles can never hurt a Sunday morning Ive enjoyed the pancakes scones eggs benedict and my favorite breakfast sammy  the dom Everything is elegantly plated and tastes really freshThe nightlife is upscale but a little Scottsdalehomogenous  everyone seems to look the same If thats the scene you crave then Narcisse is the place to beHm  Now I want breakfast food and champagneMediocre food average atmosphereit did not live up to the billing it had been given by a friendIm so over TBonesI used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wingsthe only 2 things on their menu that I liked  I was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck  But the last 3 times Ive been to TBones the food and service have been awful  And they changed the menu removing the grilled chicken breast salad that I liked  The sweet tea was almost as clear as water and painfully sweetundrinkableIm sorry TBones  We tried to make it work but it takes two  Please stop relying on the fact that youre the only place I know of in the area where you can eat the waters edge  Its just not enough to keep us coming anymore  You actually have to serve good food and decent drinksLove this place  Never had a bad meal  Good portions and great people  Be ready to stand in lineBrittany was great Fun personality quick at getting you through your order and super nice We shared a little joke as I made my order  kind of hard to explain here  but made the mundane experience of ordering a coffee into a lot of fun which is great because I was just heading off to the airport for a nice long vacation  started me off with a smile Best Cashier EverMy girlfriend and I went to this show It was absolutely terribleNot funny at all We never laughed once and after 5 minutes wanted to get the hell out of thereWe actually felt sorry for him because it was so pitifulAnd it was ridiculously loudNot sure what the others are posting 4 star reviews forLuckily we got our tickets for free If I had paid good money for them I would be furiousSave your money and do not go to this showIf you are a Marine and you come to Las Vegas you owe it to yourself to stop in and check out the Leatherneck Club  It is a BarGrill that is part Museum part Marine Corps Party House  Beer is super cheap at about 200 for domestics and the food is priced as well  One of the best burgers I have had in VegasVery very good Top notch calamari and scampi appetizers Excellent garlic breadEntrees were eggplant parm great lasagna excellent orange roughy with capers and artichokesamazing and cheese tortellini with 4 cheese sauce also greatPerfect service a really on the ball waiter Close to Hilton Tapatio  Cliffs tooCozy place nicely lit made you forget about the strip mall localeI gotta sayIve been in here a few times and each time I had a great timeReally great timeSinging along at the top of my lungs to Billy Joel songs great timeHOWEVERIve always stopped here after bar hopping a bit  This was kinda the last stop and we were all pretty buzzed each time we visited this placeI dunnoI have fond fond memories of this place thoughWoke up extra early to take this balloon flight was expecting to find the balloon already waiting for us that was not the case  This was the greatest to see how they actually put the balloon together with the basket then we boarded the balloon basketIt was so well done that we were so comfortable and had the best flight thanks to Shane Sean and MarioI have been going here for about a year and love it My stylist listens to what I want and I always leave feeling great The massages while washing hair are so relaxing They always offer tea and water and during the winter warm cider which was deliciousThe only thing I dont like is that you cant put a tip on your card Half the time I forget and have to run and get cash and go backIm basically an upbeat positive personbut some days Im not my normal corky self I arrived at Perry Monge flumoxed and in a bad mooda special event meant that all nearby lots cost 12 for parking Spending 12 for parking is spendy for a day in San Franciscobut in Phoenix for an hour Please I mentioned this to the poised woman at the checkin desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking She then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form I went to the bathroom which featured a delightful scented candle and then Sandy  brought me to the changing room and then my chair A surprise shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampooand gave me a brief massage first The massageshampoo woman had a very positive energy to her Marina cut my hair and although she was not much of a talker was upbeat and gave me a great cut Ive been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it No one will ever compare to my beloved Cid at Barbarella in San Francisco but I do have a new favorite salon locally in the Valley of the SunThis is by far the best strip club in Charlotte I come here on Wednesdays for the lunch buffet during the day which is always a steal for 10 all you can eat plus admission into the club Otherwise I usually come on Friday or Saturday night when its packed with girls The seating is comfortable and 1 large stage and three mini side stages Girls are friendly and most are above a 7 Dances are 20 and worth every penny My favorite there is Bianca who is amazing in VIPHey there everyone  This is John the Production ManagerSound Engineer at the Double Door Inn  Just happened across our venue here on Yelp and was extremely honored to see so many people saying such nice things about our room  Thanks so much to all of you for coming out and enjoying live music with us  Its something we LOVE and were lucky to be able to share it with you  As Sabrina mentioned in her review its up to us to support live music and the venues that offer it to you  Ill go ahead and step out on a limb by offering a big thank you from all of the Double Door staff for the support that music fans have given the club over the past 36 years  Looking forward to hopefully seeing all of you again and offering you many more years of great live musicI really like this place  The Children shows are awesome so when I heard of the adult shows I thought it would be brilliant  I WAS WRONGI had actually spoken to the staff prior to attending the show they told me something along the lines of it was for adults not for the easily offended but nothing xxx  I was miss informed Im not easily offended  I am also a fan of stand up comedyI am not sure where to start  I guess they feel that since its for adults they should say st every other word  The first half had sketches that were decent at best some entertaining  I laughed once or twice  Some of the puppeteers were really good at animating their puppets  All and all 1st half was eh 23 out of 5Well then there was intermission and the second half began   Oh boy where to begin where to begin  It was so slow and boring The Tucson Puppet Works should really look into another hobby  The puppets were poorly made  It was just bad  I think I heard maybe one or two people laugh during the entire thing  For about 4 minutes it was just puppets having sex  It was boring  Team America Puppets having sex funny this well this was crap  I kept hoping it wold be over and the new sketch would start  It kept going and going I finally stole a program from the person sitting next to us  When I saw that the Tucson Puppet Works had the entire second half of the show we stood up and walked out  Children Shows Awesome Adult Slams I guess the best way to describe it would be Painful Extremely PAINFULHomer Simpson Wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute Lisa honey are you saying youre never going to eat any animal again What about baconLisa Simpson NoHomer Simpson HamLisa Simpson NoHomer Simpson Pork chopsLisa Simpson Dad Those all come from the same animalHomer Simpson Chuckles Yeah right Lisa A wonderful magical animalThe pig is indeed a wonderful magical animal and Schreiners Fine Sausage is a wonderful magical place that offers the full range of porcine productsThis is a porklovers paradise  My favorite is the homemade slab bacon because it doesnt taste as salty as bacon you can buy elsewhere  They will also slice the bacon to your desired thickness  What could be better  I like my bacon sliced nice and thick setting number 6 so that the pieces cook up lovely and crisp  I top my homemade Curried Deviled Eggs with pieces of Schreiners crispy bacon  You can also buy the slab bacon if you have a recipe that calls for you to make your own lardonsSchreiners offers over 60 varieties of homemade sausages  They feature everything from Bratwurst Italian and Polish sausages to the hardtofind items such as Andouille and Tasso Cajun Linguisa Portuguese Bangers English Chorico Spanish Chorizo Mexican and Cheese SausageThey also have homemade lunch meats hickorysmoked hams and moreDont overlook their wall of pickles and pantry items  The FrischGurken baby pickles that the BF and I picked up here are the cutest addition to a relish trayThe pig is a wonderful magical animal and Schreiners Fine Sausage is a wonderful magical placeLucy was amazing Booked her last June 20th for my daughters first birthday 68pm She came early and said she would start earlier and leave the same time The grown ups loved her work as much as the kids did She stayed until everyone who wanted to be face painted got theirs done She even did balloon twisting even though I only asked for face painting She was very professional and courteous to the party Awesome awesome awesome Highly recommend her to everyone She offers the best price out there Thanks Lucy for everything Our friends have not yet stop talking about you on your great workI paid a visit to the Comedy Spot a few weeks ago on the Saturday night of my friend Gabis bachelorette weekend see review below  Im with Gabs as I also thought this would be the perfect activity postdinner for our group I think we are all seriously mistaken I also agree with Gabi that it was a bit of a buzz killliterally For the most part the comedians who performed sucked expect for one girl duo called Carlie and Doni The ROCKED So funnyBy the way the drinks were disgusting and we got yelled at for being to loud it was as cold as a meat locker inside and once again except for Carlie and Doni the comedians ABSOLUTELY SUCKEDI enjoyed Carlie and Donis performance they sang a few off songs about funny life expereinces like a bikini waxing Warning do your homework before stepping inside Make sur eyou know the comedians on the line up and try to sneak in your own drinks My mother has been at four different rehab centers in Las Vegas over the past 1 12 yearsand for the last several months we have been at TLC We could not be happier with the service staff and environment There is always a doctor on staff which is very hard to find in a rehabthe nurses are very knowledgeable courteous and attentiveand have been dedicated to giving my mother consistent attention I would highly recommend this facility to anyone who deeply cares about where their loved one is placed We cant be grateful and thankful enoughThis course has been on my radar for awhile but just a bit out of my price range but I decided to make this a tax return splurge for myself and could NOT be happier with my decision  Every hole is different  The staff is excellent  The greens while a little marked up putted true and very fast  And at a rate of 110 from their own website booked a week in advance and cheaper than golfnow btw its a far better value than your standard North Scottsdale courses and equal to or superior in quality  A couple negatives sand was a bit compacted and a couple tee boxes were hard to find a level spot  Also if the ball gets into the desert get a new one      I will play this one more time in season and several times this summer  Dont miss this  It will eventually go totally private at some pointGreat service Solid food Consistent and reliable You will not be disappointed if you go to the Avenue for drinks or for dinner A very good value for your dollar Only thing that doesnt live up to billing is the dessertLet there be no question Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades Try a burger on Italian bread The service is flawlessly friendly the food is amazing and the wings Oh the wings but its still about the cheeseburger The atmosphere is inviting but you cant eat atmosphere so go right now Grab the car keys you know youre hungry for an amazing cheeseburger maybe some wings and a cold beer Easily hands down the best bar and grill in PittsburghThis review is based on observing my daughters class in the firecrackers groupI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY FOR FIRST TIMERS OR INEXPERIENCED TODDLERS How class goes there are two instructors per class One instructor gives a quick demonstration giving them instructions what to do on the equipment at each station The kids chose which station they want to start at and then they rotate from station to station What Ive been seeing all the kids are at different skill levels different heights different ages and some are better at following directions than others While some of the children are able and capable of maneuvering around the equipment themselves other children who are too little or inexperienced end up waiting around until either A The instructors finally make their way to helping a different station B a kid gets impatient and has to ask the instructor for help or C The child gets bored and starts wandering around and doing whatever they please getting in the way of the other kids Let me be honest and say my daughter was definitely C She is too short to reach most of the equipment on her own she is also inexperienced in gymnastics and she has a high energy level with very little attention span Throughout most of class she was waiting around for help get bored and do her own thing ultimately getting in the way of everyone else Several times neither of the instructors noticed that she walked away to another class or was off in a corner away from everyone just playing by herself The instructors neglect in engaging with the children All I have seen them do is spot the children on the equipment They do not have any kind of activities for the children to do together as a class they do nothing to make their learning experience a fun experience Im not trying to tell anyone how to do their jobs but perhaps it could be beneficial to divide the kids into two groups one group per instructor and start at two different stations rotating together keeping the kids into two groups instead of fourfive Maybe that way the kids can each possibly get more attention from the instructor and even be kept an eye on more easily I dont know if it would work but its a suggestionthey definitely need to rethink what they can do to better organize the class as a whole and better engage the kids it would be appreciated for them to evaluate what they can do to maximize the services they are being paid for I absolutely did not respect one of the instructors putting my daughter on a time out during a class He said she was too hyper and he didnt want she or any of the kids to get hurt so he put her on a time out to calm down I understand that he was thinking of their safety BUT I didnt believe a time out was fair because honestly if they had been paying more attention they would have noticed her standing in line waiting to be helped for almost 10mins before she decided to have free play And each time she went to another station she would wait for so long before getting bored Can you blame her or any other kid shes only 4 five minutes to them is equivalent to 3060 minutes I am not upset about the time out itself I do believe in discipline I care that she got put in time out for entertaining herself due to the lack or organization by the instructors Truthfully the class looks like free play being monitored by instructors who only help them on the equipmentafter they wait and wait and wait until one of them are available They could improve their class by adding activities and games that relate to gymnastics and can help bring the class together as a whole AlsoI cant stress this enoughthe instructors really need to engage with the children rather than just spotting them on the equipment Fortunately I used a Groupon deal before deciding to register for regular classes She has one more class to complete and then we will be looking into other gymnastic businesses  I am exceptionally disappointed with the experience my daughter has had with this company Fortunately she is only 4 so she doesnt know the difference but she will absolutely not be returningIm sitting here at China King and am baffled at the high rating The waitress told me they would not honor the Yelp  checkin special  The restaurant is filthy There is a film on the windows and a pair of childrens shoes strewn across the waiting area  The child I think they belong to is actually standing on top of chairs SCREAMING for his mom This is AWFUL  There is also a dirty empty bucket just outside of the front door Im not sure why but eww The mens room is SO GROSS and theres just all sorts of eww everywhere My best instinct tells me I shouldnt have bothered but I gave it a whirl and The food wasnt horrible The fried rice was really bland The Egg Drop Soup was kinda barfy It had nasty peas corn and carrots and the vegetables had been dehydrated they werent dehydrated very well My entree was General Tsos Chicken It was certainly the highlight of the experience but the chicken itself seemed oddly dense and of low quality The prices werent super great either Im guessing all the hype is about the Dim Sum and the more exotic seafood offerings Im still in disbelief that they would not accept the checkin special filth factor makes me wonder what kind of public health hazard China King isI am a bit partial to this bar Our Band Screaming Ant plays there all the time The bar itself  has been around along time and shows its age But whats inside are the nicest folks I ever ran across in my life  It has pool Large tvs for Sport games Live MusicThe entertainment draws from some of the best rock  bands in the valley and brings some good ole rock and roll that you you just dont find anywhere elseNow  besides the playing there I have no relations with anyone in the place and all I know is that when I ask the owner if I could use the bar for an event to raise money for my sister who has been diagnosed with cancer With out a blink of an he said yes and they have been great help at helping me organize the eventThe bar has a huge parking lot and easy accessThe Bartender and waitresses or really on their game  I remembered as I left the place that I was really happy and I wanted to go back When we get Gigs there our band gets excited that is because the crowds are fun and it seems like we make new friends everything we playA colleague and I are traveling across the states working for a rock n roll touring act and we have been going to many karting courses Victory lane is by far our most favorite We make it a priority to come here every time we are near Charlotte  The course is awesome and the karts are insanely fast These are GAS powered not electric So much better The staff is incredibly knowledgable and their kitchen made us specialty food items We had such an awesome experience here and we will DEFINITELY be back soon If we lived nearby wed be here multiple nights a weekThis was adequte at best and that is being generous  Several of us Went today for Easter brunch  big disappointment  The restaurant was not that busy  took 20 minutes between courses being served  Needed to ask for plates for the muffins  Ordered the filet with eggs  the eggs were burnt and broken  The server never should have brought that plate to the table  I expect this from Dennys at 3 am  not a restaurant with these menu prices  My boyfriend had the tomato bisque soup  was Ragu in a bowl  even same consistency  Another friend had the bananas foster french toast  even the bananas were blandLove it here Best bar at WestgateIm not usually the bar going type but I really enjoy this particular one and I dont feel like people are bumpin and grindin all over the place uncomfortable Came here with some friends last weekend and we all had a great time and its enjoyable for the designated driver as well Independent local business knowledgeable staff great selections and MOUNTAINS OF VINTAGE GOODIES AND YOU CAN STILL ORDER NEW STUFF TOOif you cant find what you wanted they will order it for you or if you are a regular keep an eye out for a rare item for ya They also take preorders on vinyl and new video games as well and they video games are the exact same price as Lamestop anywayThe video game selection is amazing and always changingThey have new and used vintage and modern cds and records for fair pricesThey will also take store credit for cool use stuff so you can trade old records and game for that new game you want if ya got the right stuff at the right timePeople keep saying its expensive but i disagree i believe the prices are very fair for their quality and the cash goes right back into our local economy i think most people dont understand the cost of local and niche goods i used to work at a record store and shipping vinyl is expensive so if you are used to walmart prices then go thereOH THATS RIGHT walmart doesnt carry ANY GOOD MUSIC let alone support local musicians with events and sell their merch gee funny how that worksIf you are a treasure hunter i highly recommend this place I have found some real gems simply because i was rooting through a random spot in the storeFor my girlfriends birthday I took her to Mary Elaines which is a super fancy French restaraunt in Scottsdale AZ My brother has worked there for a few years now and hes been suggesting that we experience it The staff was extremely attentive and pleasant addressing us by name and taking a moment to replace my girlfriends blue napkin with a black one to match her dress They even brought over a small stool for me to set my digital camera on The restaraunt is situated on the top floor of the Phoenician Resort and every seat at Mary Elaines has a spectacular view of the valleyWe let the chef prepare a tasting menu for us and their Sommelier wine expert paired wines with many of the tastings I will have to consult with my brother to fully explain the dishes served but the food was so fine tuned to perfection that I can not imagine improvement I HIGHLY recommend EVERYONE eat at Mary Elaines at least once as it is truly the finest experience in dining I can imagineI posted images of our food here  httpwwwsecretstrandlandcomMaryElainesSo Ive been here like a kazillion times but never thought about posting a review for it This place is sausage heaven crack all the jokes you want haha  I moved back to Cen Pho about a year and a half ago and had always wanted to check this place out but never did I was instantly hooked and have been a loyal customer ever since  They have tons of different types of sausages and dogs Most come smoked or fresh Im a huge fan of their smoked Linguisa and their Chorico They also have these odds and ends mixed sausagebrathotdog skewers for like 2 bucks a poundand Im a real sucker for those The prices are awesome you can get out under 20 with a great mix of sausages and brats for the grill Make this your Goto spot for grilling this summer and trust me you wont be disappointedI have been getting adjusted  by Dr Luster for about four years now and can honestly say he is the only chiropractor I let adjust me now  The adjustments are smooth and the time and planning he puts into your care is unlike any other  Most Chiropractors I grew up going to would adjust you in a minute or two and be off to the next patient  Dr Luster actually takes the time to figure out whats causing the problem and oddly enough will even take time to chat with you and make sure you feel comfortable  He really is a great doctor I wish more Chiropractors were more like him  Stop wasting time searching around trust me youll love him  The front desk staff is friendly and will always greet you by name which i thought was a great plus as wellAlas I moved away from the valley over a year ago and I miss Bob and Kristin I only wish I could clone them and spread their copies across to other statescitiesregions to impart their wealth of knowledge on wines food and beer Couple that with a passion for all things food and a cool midwestern friendlinesssigh I cant say enough good things about them Las Vegas is lucky to have two of the most genuine and passionate people about food and wine Anyone who hasnt visited their shop  much less talked to them asking them for any helpwell theyre just missing out arent theySure you can get some of the same stuff elsewherebut you really miss out on the character and the ambiance here They are soooooooo nice and will entertain your questions no matter how naive they are Every week FriSat they have wine tastings and they offer monthly classes sign up early bc they fill up fast on wine  from 20 to 50 per class Sign up for the email newsletters too  you get the latest offerings from new seasonal wines cheeses candies etc Want to request something Or try the latest and greatest cheese Ask them They even cut the cheese to your order  I wanted a small sliver just for myself and they had no problem Want a gift basket for friends and family Yup they do that too Kristin will hand select items for you even if you dont know what you wantbut they are SOOOOOOO accommodating and friendly that you dont have to worry about feeling intimidated by their selectionRide your bike all over town and just need a place to rest They do that too Im serious I used to ride my bicycle on Saturdays tofrom Lake Mead in the sweltering dry heat of the LV summer On the way back Id stop by their shop and they always offered me a glass of water and let me park my bike inside while I shopped When I moved away they even recommended places where I could get great cheeses and winesSend in the clonesNever had a bad mealWe had been to Tien Wong hotpot in Chandler TSpot about ten times and had high hopes for Shabu Fondue It delivered and then some the portion sizes tripled and the quality was identical as the old location My only complaint was that it was uncomfortably hot in there needed to be 510degrees cooler to offset all the steaming hot pots This place remains awesomeThe barista was super sweet I told her I wanted something new and she was a fountain of information She made a lot of great suggestions and I told her to wing it She went with a Caramel Brulee with two pumps of White Mocha She also gave me a discount which was awesomeI used an AirCard on the netbook and sat in Starbucks from 11am230pm I had headphones on and just zoned out I was comfortable and wasnt disrupted at allIt seemed to get busy from 1pm2pm so if you want to stop at this location make sure to get there earlier so you can grab a seatAbsolutely delicious Very friendly service as wellGot 2 broths Thai and Chinese with 2 meats shabu beef and pork loin 2 vegetables shiitake mushroom and napa cabbage 1 house special firm tofu and oval noodlesThis place is awesome We cant eat regular store bought brats anymore Their potato salad is to die for as wellWhen you walk in you get a strong smell ofwell something awesome and smokey and realize behind the register there are smoked something or others hanging right there in front of you To the left are some grocery items as well as spietzle sp and some other items To the right is the deli counter that holds TONS of meats and other goodies as well as their brats They have two kinds from what I have seen course ground and find ground I believe I am not sure of the difference since we usually only get the fine ground white onesThey make limited portions of everything since its all fresh so get there fast for the potato saladThis is our go to for grilling out and its always deliciouslike the star says dont come hereIm in the culinary program and the only reason im in it is to get my GPA up to go to JWU down the road Im giving these people 30000 for a certificate degree not even an associates degree and I have no idea where my money is goingwhy because every day i come to class we run out of some type of food or necessary supplies and they are usually out of stock on all their suppliesThe apartments they stick us in arent even close to what they advertise and they stick us in a fairly bad part of town thats actually 20 minutes away from the campusand dont get me started on the students here if you like the fact that they accept just about anybody and yes that includes people with under a 20 GPA and people whove been out of school for 20 years then youll do fine here If youre like me and you dont like how the school accepts everyone just so they can pocket the cash then dont go hereI really regret giving these people my money but its the quickest way to get into JWU and get a little experience while im at it Save your money and go to JWU much better investmentYum yum yum  I felt the need to update the restaurant  Nothing has changed and that is what I loveConsistency is appreciate when the quality is so high  I appreciate that their burgers are as special juicy and flavorful as always  They are not trying to dress up the place or make things so fancy  The truth is they stick to good simply and quality food  So thank you for staying the same and staying fabulousWorst business ethics I have ever seen No wonder they bar the place up they are crooks Went in with an limited edition Ford watch They pulled one up on there computer that was not even close to the watch I brought in tring to compare prices The reason they could not find the one I have is because of its rarity The employees have no knowledge of anything and are very sloppy with no customer service The boss  Insulted me with a useless offer would not even look me in the face and walked away in middle of conversation  Something shady is a foot Bottom line I got out of the geto and got 250 more then what they offered Just pass this place and move on To the manager just because someone is tring to sell something does not make them desperate maybe if i had boobs you would have talked to meGreat Company to work with Found the website a little confusing but all worked out Very happy with results and customer serviceWow Too bad I dont have a turntable Cos this place specializes in vinyl They have records records and more records  Me I have a huge CD collection  I dont believe in MP3 players because if you only have songs downloaded you dont really have a music collectiom do you  There are some purists who believe that the best sound is on vinyl and my father is one of them  To back up a moment my husband Rick was out of town for the day on one of his railfan jaunts  So my brother Paul and I decided to get together hang out and maybe get a little Christmas shopping out of the way  Dad likes music as much as we do  He even likes more current bands like Arcade Fire and Snow Patrol  We decided that some used LPs would make a big splash with the old man  On an earlier family visit I pilfered his record and CD collection while Paul created a diversionWe decided upon getting him Damn the Torpedos from Tom Petty  The Heartbreakers and a rare LP by The Busboys  Man I have got to get me a turntable  This place is awesome and I could spend hours in here  Now isnt shopping and browsing at a place like this way more fun than Amazon or EBayDo you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars  this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop  I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing  It is 1130 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full  there are always people coming going getting coffeeIt is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place elseEnricos also has become a hub for other community activities  there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet hereOther reasons to love this place I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating free wifi outside tables tasty treats they have a blog really great coffee the staff are coffee expertsThe most relaxing bed and breakfast in Southern Arizona  Linda the owner is wonderful  She really goes out of her way to make sure you have a comfortable stay  And her dogs are charming too  You get so much more than what you pay for  The breakfast is technically a continental breakfast but it really leaves you satisfied  yogurt toast fruit juice coffee cereal oatmeal all kinds of good stuff  The beds are comfortable and the rooms are spotless  My favorite feature is the pool area  a two person hammock spa with a little waterfall and a grill that guests can use for BBQs  Lovely place to get away for a night or twoand really feel like you took a vacationWow does Yelp offer 0 stars I didnt get a chance to even see the food but based on the other reviews I am probably not missing much This is my first time in Montreal I flew up for the weekend from Virginia I had a 3 am flight and arrived here around noon and was extremely hungry After walking around I noticed this place and walked in My girlfriend and I walked into a busy atmosphere and a couple of guys behind us walked in as well The hostess was working on getting a table for a woman in front of us and completely took off before acknowledging we had walked in Then to make room I walked closer to the hostess desk and another woman walked up and the dbags behind me started speaking French and the woman wrote them down They didnt even tell the woman I was there first  So then she proceeds to not know how to speak English which is be of the two languages of this country While the real hostess was being useless this woman misspelled my name as she was taking my information and I told her I was here before those two guys and she said no I wasnt What a piss poor manager place and I dare the manager or owner to contact me so I can tell him how rude is staff is at the door If you are traveling avoid this place like the plague Im sure Montreal has plenty to offer and even though so dbags have already ruined my experience here even though us Americans can be rude we still know our place and dont treat tourist like shtI stayed at The Inn on Mexican War Streets for one night in late May 2014 I stayed in Mr Boggs room and felt a bit like a wealthy tycoon in the large grand roomThe Inn has a very grand appearance on the outside which continues on the inside While not in pristine condition the inside is certainly not shabby and is clean My bed was very comfortable I met only one of the two innkeepers sorry I dont recall his name but he was very nice and helpful I wouldnt say the neighborhood is packed with restaurants and bars but there are several good ones within a three to four block walk Theres also a nice park immediate across the street from the InnIf I need to return to Pittsburgh Ill certainly stay at the Inn on Mexican War Streets again you should tooLast call is a 1130pm  Fail  The Bourbon steak bar is awesome cuz there is nobody in it  Fat people are lonersCool atmosphere and nice staff The food is reasonably priced for what you get My wife is Taiwanese and is quite happy with the quality of the foodThe hot pot is above table not an inside the table hot pot you get in Asia  Really enjoyed the California rolls Definitely would recommend this place for anyone looking for hot pot or a cool asian restaurant for date nightHad a blast at this spot  and not just because i whooped my bfs ass either on the trackbhahahaanywho we signed up and became members cheaper to do it that way if you think you will get the urge to race often Member is 14 and some change and non member is 20 You sign up pick a racing name that will permanently been yours forever and eva  Sexyspeeder right here   you get a head sock you will have to wear under the Helmet free tshirt if you sign up also  LADIES wear closed toe shoes i had to borrow some of theres and lets just say i never want to wear rental shoes againYou can race as much as you want take breaks in between or do back to back if you choose On Sundays they combine the tracks together so its an even longer track it was really fun those little karts go pretty fast  and they do take bumping very seriouslythey will pull your grown ass over and scold you like a little kid if they catch youi know cause they gave my bf a talkin too they keep track of your best lap and which place you came in and you get a paper that records all this my 1 is plastered on the refrigerator whoop whoopIf your looking for some competitive fun try this place out They also have food drinks rock wall and arcade also Also might be a cool spot to throw a kids bday party alsovroomvroomI took the 4 day Grand Prix Racing program Excellent serious racing preparation Race theory and car control are taught in the classroom and drilled into you on the track You perform repetitive exercises to learn heeltoe sifting emergency race avoidance maneuvers and apex exercises Official races were held between our group where we had to react correctly to the flags thrown The instructors are racers and very good they rate your performance daily 80 of my time was spent on the track in the car LOTS of seat timeA couple guys brought their personal rides Ferrari Aston Martin and worked a deal to take them on the track awesome I stayed at the fantastic Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort  Spa right across the street from the racetrackMy driving skills increased dramatically and it was the best time Ive ever had Highly recommendedIf you work uptown this is a great location for you  I get my hair and eyebrows done here and have also have had several massages  The staff is really sweet  they always remember what wine I like  There is enough staff to fit your needs and price ranges  They do reminder calls which I LOVE cause I make my appts months in advanceThere is a central desk that triages all Modern calls so if you are running late it is kind of annoying because you cant just call the location you are going to  But the desk will let them know right away so it has always worked outit is just odd that it is hard to get ahold of the your specific location  Love you Modern  I always leave feeling pampered and fabulous  DEvery time I go in here they have great looking plants and flowers  excellent customer service Ive been a regular for several years and always look forward to stopping by Great place to shop local Check it outI recently had to go to American Stitch due to a huge mess up on about 50 out of 150 football jerseys Wrong names misspelled names wrong numbersyou name it and it was wrong After going to 6 different sports stores giving me ridiculous pricing we found American Stitch Matthew fixed them for less than half of what other places quoted and they looked great He put a rush order on them so we could have our players in full uniform before the next game Great customer service and great priceI love going to the opera I am always impressed with the vocal range of the performers They can do amazing things with their voices And the sets and costumes are so elaborate That is the best part Even though they are usually sung in a language that I dont understand you can really get swept up in the emotion of the music I usually read the program beforehand so that I know whats going on and then try my best not to stay fixated on the subtitles on the screen but instead just enjoy the action on the stage the orchestra and of course the singingWent in to rent a tux for prom and although it looks a little run down the service is actually really really great the whole staff was friendly I was helped by a pretty woman called Nicole and she was on top of everything and the total was under 80 which blew me away Great great placeGreat service friendly staff great food great prices What more can you ask for in a small town breakfast place Will definitely be backLove this place  If you are looking for a good bar pretty ladies and great food  You have found it  We reserved a couch for the SB this year and the service was over the top  My drink was never dry and the food was perfect The servers were delightful engaging and wore revealing but not too revealing outfitsI know it may look sketchy from the outside but highly recommendedI have been getting my hair cut and hilighted at Mane Attractions for over 5 years by Sue the owner I am always extremely happy with the way my hair looks   My hair is very fine and I dont have a whole lot of it but Sue does wonders with it especially with my latest cut I never wanted it shorter than shoulder length but decided recently to make a change Because Im getting older and other methods of increasing the volume and amount of my hair were too expensive or didnt work  I wanted to try a shorter cut The cut she gave me made my hair look much thicker I have had several compliments on the cut one from another hairstylist who worked at Regis Sue is also reasonable charging 80 for my cut and hilights I will admit that I had to wait outside the salon once when I was the first customer of the day but that was once in over 5 years I will take an occasional late opening in exchange for the great cutscolor I getCheap delicious fresh coffee  Im not talking about the stale cup of plain joe you get at ANY other regular coffee shop that tastes like dirty burned coffee beans  If your office doesnt have a coffee maker I highly suggest making a trip down here  If youre concerned about the preparation  its regular old drip coffee not percolator so do with that information what you willA medium java sets you back only 170 and they have a ton of flavored coffees if youre into that  Normally Im not but I tried the Hawaiian Macadamia Nut today and ALOHAAAAA delicious  You cant really beat it for a cheap and good quality cuppa  side note there is a 3 minimum for credit cards so bring cash if youre coming down for just coffeeIm only giving this place a 1star because there is no zerostar option The whole place is a disorganized mess Its riddled with building code and health code violations For example they have camping stoves on the tables but no exhaust hoods to ventilate the room They have exposed outlets The place is a wreck The food was decent but stay away from the blue crab unless you bring your own claw crackers They dont have them No one comes to bus your table The one point they left a bussers tub on the floor by our table which we used to dispose of our used dishes Oh and if you order appetizers be sure to savor them an hour into your meal that isReally like the gym most of the time  except for the Kids Club  If you have kids younger than school age  this gym is not for you  They have a time limit which they dont bother to mention prior to getting you to join  Then if you go over 3 times  your membership is suspended   I have not even been able to go over to the weight lifting section of the gym after 3 weeks of membership  thanks to the kids club   Also have to leave classes early which is disruptive ie in yoga again thanks to kids club  The girls who work there are snotty and make snide remarks if you are even a couple of minutes late    I have written a letter to corporate but I am told that I will never get a response   So once again as a single working mother with child I feel that I am paying more than the average person to work out there plus I am not able to work out as long as other people who pay less   Completely frustrating   I signed up for 80000 worth of Summer Kids Campswhich I have subsequently withdrawn from due to the bad attitude of the Kids Club employees   So if you dont have kids the gym would be greatWhen I lived in Vegas I was right behind the place I was coming home from a mid week bender in the strip Didnt feel like going home and I was all jacked up on vodkared bull and hungry I stopped in here cuz I hadnt checked it out Met someone right away from the Chicago burbs Bartender was a cool guy Had a pizza and Im from Chicago so Im a pizza snob I was kinda drunk but that fawker tasted great Had a beer or two then stumbled home and passed outI cant say enough good things about this place  I was introduced to it when a couple of friends of mine got married here  I am still impressed by it five years later  There are a few eating options here a couple of restaurants and a large picnic area  Its an oasis in the middle of south Phoenix  The area around it is nice too the old farming lifestyle all around  If you werent around in Phoenix twenty years ago you can see the type of farming pockets that used to exist in more frequency around the city  The only thing missing is an orange orchard with the trees painted white at the trunksThey charge an annual administrative fee that is not covered by insurance  Basically its like a credit card annual fee  This year 2012 its 60  Im not one to pay annual fees at my bank on credit cards and definitely dont want to start at my doctors office   Its up to you thoughOff the Hook amazing selection of cheeseGo hereI really really wanted to try Dor  Stop but it wasnt open when I went My wife and I woke up early just to go there and the diner was closed for the next few days EVEN THOUGH IT DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE WEBSITE Such a waste of time If youre going to go make sure you call ahead just so you dont get screwed over like we didAbsolute best place to buy a quality bike in Pittsburgh The staff really loves cycling and shares their extensive knowledge with you to help find the best bike for you I didnt feel like I was being upsold anything I really trust this place Frequent customer for lifeMy favorite restaurant in townHere is the deal with Umi  if you are a casual sushi eater and just a fan of your basic rolls and stuff dont bother going here Umi is expensive rolls will seem small  same as the sashimi and nigiriHowever it is so darn delicious I cant even describe it  If I could i would go to Umi every night  Its simply that good  Its well well worth every cent you will spendAlso try the rock shrimp  Oh manI think I am gonna go make a reservation right nowWe went to Shabu Fondu with a group and we had a great experience The staff was friendly accomodating and helpful The food was great and it was fun to cook it yourself The menu is rather extensive and it would be easy to eat vegetarian here They served there water with some cucumber and that was also tasty The wife and I had the Curry and Shabu Beef Broccoli Bok Choy and Rice Noodles It was a winning combowe checked out 4 rooms just to see what it was like moldy ceilings  musty smells unclean rooms and such a huge renovation job it should be shut down or discounted by 99 thank god hotwire gave us a refundEasily one of my favorite places in urban Phoenix I am a member and we go often What is there not to like Its unique It changes There are events by a bundle Even food is semi OK for such place Go there No i mean it Go Stroll through major Roads venture to some smaller once talk to those nice elderly For the most part volunteers who will teach you about surviving on Prickly Pears or how Succulent is different from a CactusDo not liter run around or yell like an idiot please Besides that  HAVE FUN This place is awesome I likeVery niceEugeneThis hotel is beyond disgusting be sure to read the tripadviser reviews also If you book this through a discount place like I did Expedia you will regret it Janice at the front desk looks like a Walmart shopper with a rude tone as well  We were shown a room standard that smelled like urine with one 2X3 window overlooking the parking lot The lobby had a used Qtip behind the chair and garbage strewn about Place is worn and tiredThe owners of these place should pay more attention of how some workers act very  disrespectful to the clients very bad service and too much ego from upthight worker specially the big asian guythis is WAY better than karaoke and a thousand times more fun Definitely not the scene for people who werent raised on classic rock if all you love is R  B and the only songs you know by heart are rap youre not going to like it here as much as i doIm always stoked to come here and get to sing a little diddy about jack and diane while together we lament the day the music died and have one last dance with mary jane until the midnight hour when we cried MORE MORE MORE In the very end well put bread in their jars and say man what are you doing hereThe Big Bang is a huge hit with the entertainment truly making this place ive come in here by myself with a large group of people and with just a significant other it doesnt matter who im with were all in here to get great drinks and shout great classic memories along with the VERY talented pianists who all also double as drummer and bassistsguitarists I highly recommend this barrelofmonkeys type entertainment but beware the language gets foul and we all get a little rowdy and if you didnt understand my paragraph on what gets me so stoked about this place youre not going to get why so many people love it hereAnother bad experience two times in a row There must be a shortage of waitstaff in Charlotte because these people shouldnt even be working at Walmart Both times we went for lunch and took an hour and a half They served soup which took almost 40 minutes to get egg drop and it look like low tide in Louisiana Big chunks of gray and black eggs floating in my egg drop soup waitress looking at me like I was crazy The manager came over to serve our food and asked how is everything I mention I was going to write a bad Yelp review and he said well thank you and walked away This place used to have a long wait and now theres nobody ever there now I understand why Portions are small service is bad and probably better off going to McDonaldsTalk about customer service This place runs smoothly and comes highly recommendedI am a 3rd generation Arizonan and seeing hot air balloons rise up from the desert has been a memory since I can remember 31 years into my life I was finally able to experience balloon flight and I can tell you how incredibly glad I selected FLOAT Matt Olivia and their team provided a one of a kind experience not just in the hot air balloon but before and after from the moment you arrive to fresh Cartel coffee to a seasonally  local curated breakfast and champagne when you land Theres no question that Ill be coming back to FLOAT with friends and family in the future Thank you tremendouslyWhat fun  My oldest 5 and I ditched daddy and baby sister to come out for the 2014 production of Nutcracker and it was delightful  Our tickets thank you Yelp were in the orchestra level and we had a great view of the production  I was surprised at how many other kids were in the theater and I think for the length and time of night I wouldnt have wanted to take anyone younger than my almostsixyearoldSo the ballet It was set in Pittsburgh which was fun and there were some additions we hadnt see before like the mysterious Nephew  The dancing was wonderful as expected  My daughter was confused about the lack of dialog but the program had a very helpful synopsis that helped her understand what was happening  The first act was fun with magic acts dancing dolls and of course the fight with the rats and mice and quite enjoyable  The ending of the first act was quite soothing and in the dark theater I admit I was afraid of snoozingThe second act  The national dances were amazing especially the arabian dance Holy cow talk about amazing abs  Then it got to the point where the sugar plum fairy danced then her consort danced then they danced together then the fairy dancedand it did drag a little  I loved the creativity though of the carousel and the imagination of the set and costumes  There was a part with the lambs that was awfully cute and we loved watching the kids any time they were on stage  There were several side stories going on in the periphery of the stage that you could get absorbed in and it was just very well done  Overall I think that this will now be our Christmas tradition  It was wonderfulEnjoy coming here to watch a game of football or basketball They have football food specials There happy hour is half off on pizzas and drinks If you like a Ruben try the Sean Patricks signature pizza Amazing Also try the Sean Patricks chips its their take on Nachos All their burgers are well cooked and have awesome flavor They opened up a new cigar lounge next to the pool table and shuffle board Its the only PTs bar with a cigar lounge Its has comfortable seating two big screen tvs and 3 humidors filled with cigars Gets busy during a football game so come early to grab seating in thereWill always recommend Sean PatricksI was lucky to get a tour of the Benedum last month and I was completely impressed  This is a painstakingly restored historic building with marvelous architectural and design details  It is absolutely an beautiful place to go see a musical the opera ballet or a concert  The staff is amazing and extremely professional they run this place like clockwork  I love the natural acoustics of the building although I dont recommend that you sit under the balcony thats the worst place to hear a good sound  Dont worry about getting overdressed for an event at the Benedum this is a truly unique and beautiful landmark that exudes eleganceI had read about Soba in Pittsburgh Magazine I was intrigued when I saw that Soba was Numbero Uno according to a recent readers poll And doubly impressed that it was listed as one of the magazines top 25 restaurants in the city With a build up like that I was very excited to dine here We had an early evening reservation The exterior is described as 3 story Victorian Looked like a homely dump to me Inside was a very different story Sleek and modern with a Zen like garden feel we were excited as little kids to be lead to table on the 3rd floor near the bar area I thought the atmosphere was tranquil and very romantic I started with the thai corn chowder with crab meat I was taken aback by the color a sort of dreary garymustard But it was very delicious very spicy My BBF had a salad that was very flavorful with chicken and fresh spring greens We were also served an appetizer with cucumber and pita chips For dinner we had the filet mignon and the seafood hot pot The filet was extremely thick and served with a nice vegetable mixture and potatoes  The flavor was amazing  The seafood looked delicious I sampled the shrimp and they were very well seasoned Dessert was also just as amazing We shared the vanillaroasted Asian pear served with a gingerbread biscuit Asian pear sorbet and sabayon We also shared a chai spiced creme caramel flan It was so yummy with pumpkin seed brittle and vanilla chantilly All in all a very special evening Everything was wonderfully presented and service was very good  I have to agree with the readers of Pittsburgh magI hate writing bad reviews but I wasnt very impressed with this place for the prices they charge  All was not lost though since I had printed out a coupon from their website for 20 off The pedicure stations dont have massage chairs and I didnt think my manicure was as clean and nice as it could have been The lady who did my nails was super nice but I dont think Ill be returning to Total Bliss unless its for a different kind of serviceGood honest food at a fair price made by cheerful folk Ive been going there for years and am rarely disappointedPlace has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate You get a really big side of home fries too This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting Service is usually fast and friendly Two downsides to the place 1 they are cash only which can be an inconvenience I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM 2 the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast The lunches and dinner selections arent bad eitherGene Sanes remade boat cushions for our 28 sailboat interior  Incredible craftsmanship and attention to detail The cushions are beautiful They also made coordinating curtains and throw pillows Delivered on time actually 1 week early and very accommodating to my family who helped pick up the cushions in two waves Thank youI was in the market for a new stylist since mine fled the Phoenix scene in search of cooler weather in Colorado I went to my Aveda store to pick up some products and there was a stylist from Perry Monge Marie Luce  sp gave me a coupon for 2000 off so I decided to give it a tryOMG From the moment I walked in I felt like royalty I think I was getting the first timeservice but not only did I get one of the best haircuts a styling a 5 minute back massage a very thorough hand massage a facial  yepeyebrow waxing a makeup refresher and an iced cappuccino I wound up buying 3 products but I always buy something Aveda when I go so it wasnt a hard sellI love my new lookmy skin looks amazing and the total cost was 12200 What I had a 2000 off coupon but stillIt was brilliant marketing I have found a new stylist and I will be faithful in getting a facial each time I go because its so worth it I highly recommend Marie Luce she is amazingThe people who work here are very rude I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person but no it happen every time I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there It is like you are walking into someones house and bothering them The people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation Plus it is very dirty Perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other I will not go back againI recently went to a wedding reception here I felt sorry for the bride and groom The place was not clean for starters The food was the worst part The salad was soggy from the dressing sitting on it for far too long and then they put on top a hot fresh baked bread stick that came from the freezer which in turn made the salad hot I had the sirloin it was cold chewy and bland My date had the vegetarian pasta it was over done spinach pasta with some sort of flavorless cream sauce and veggies Mix in overpriced drinks and you have one of the worst wedding reception venues ever Stay awayWow these idiots who gave 1 star rating must be dork hipsters who know nothing about record collecting  Ive been a customer at Jerrys since he was in Oakland  Great guy great store  It is one of a kind and known across the world  You could spend a week going through everythingI was willing to accept the expensive mediocre boba tea I was also willing to accept the 20 minute wait both times I orderedWhat Im not willing to accept is that the cashier told me they were out of boba I ordered tea anyway The people who ordered before me got boba which makes sense However the couple that ordered after I did got boba tooSo they were only out of boba for my drinkI have a degree in hotel and restaurant management so you could probably say that i am a little more critical than most people when it comes to eating out  Tonight my girlfriend and I went to Christos  Our server was horribly slow at taking our drink orders and a table that came in after us already had their salads before we had even placed our order  The food was mediocre at best we got to go boxes because after an hour of sitting in the restaurant that apparently caters to close personal friends of Abe Lincoln that have nothing more to do than waste an evening at an overpriced restaurant to fill up on caesar salad that tastes like it was dipped in anchovy paste and wish that you hadnt ordered the veal genovese because it just looks like someone threw up on your plate you just want to get out of thereI was so lucky to stumble upon the Priory I came to Pittsburgh for a conference The Westin at the convention center was booked so I had to find alternative lodging and came across this place I love this hotel  The historic building is beautiful  The beds are comfortable The staff are very friendly and helpful  They have a wonderful free continental breakfast in the morning  Its near bars and restaurants a nail salon and a grocery store I was surprised to find that beer is not sold in grocery stores in Pennsylvania  Luckily you can buy a variety of chilled beers at the front desk which is open 24 hrs The local pizza place delivers until 2 am  Its walking distance to the Andy Warhol Museum  Also its only a 2 minute drive from the convention center and much cheaper than the Westin  I paid 105night The tv was very small and the water pressure was weak but everything else exceeded my expectationsThe customer service here was top notch We came in to find a suit for my man he is 66 and thin so finding clothes to fit him is near impossible We were greeted by Steve as soon as we walked in Before we know it he had the measuring tape out and several different suit options in hand He also gave recommendations on shirt and tie combinations They were having a 40 off sale on the entire store so we got a great deal They were also able to tailor the suit pants within 4 days I now have the exact pant and shirt measurements which will make it easy for future shopping extravaganzasThanks Steve You did a great jobAfter investing into higher end aftermarket car parts for my vehicle I found a need or want for ceramic coating Snail Motorsports came recommended to me from various friends colleagues and business partners Being that the items I purchased were not a small investment I decided to take the recommendations and bring my business to Snail9 months later I still continue to bring all of my ceramic coating needs to Snail Motorsports Every order Ive placed with Snail small or large cost not only size has been consistently of the utmost quality As someone who chooses to invest his hard earned money on an item it gives me relief to know Snail will always provide quality service care and most of all GREAT customer serviceTo speak briefly about comparison Ive since had experience with other local coating shops Although the quality and care of the work done elsewhere was sufficient I will continue to use Snails services when I need quality work done correctly the first time Thanks Snail Keep up the great workWe had a series of misfortunate events take place from the moment we arrived all the way through to the time we left  Its actually quite sad because Id like to share the information but Id rather lick dog poop off the bottom of my shoe than waste another moment of my life on this place  Its awful and we wont be going back  The worst of our experience  Lets just say that the hotel employee who used his master access to open up our room while we were in it with the privacy sign on pretty much sealed the deal here  If anyones had theft problems this may be why  Hotel staff was quick to throw out sorry for each thing that went wrong but we strongly suspect nobody meant what they said I didnt want to give this place any stars but one star is needed to submit this reviewI will never go back to this place again because their customer service was really very poor espescially the lady who always thereI will never recommend this to anyone it was a bad experience of being hereIf you want a good tasty budget brat says my bossman go for the johnsonville smoked cheddar jalepeno  cringeTwo things here  1 what the heck is a budget brat and 2 BARF  If youre going to eat meat in tube form  Do yourself a favor  spend the extra 20 cents per pound yes I actually checked some brat prices go down to Bavaria Sausage Kitchen and get the real thing  Theyve got your regular brats your fresh brats your smoked brats your beer brats your weiners your weisswurst your polish and a bunch of sausages youve probably never heard of but are undoubtedly delicious  I did a BBQ for about 70 people which gave me the opportunity to load up on just about every tubed meat in the case  Plus BSK has their more popular products packed in cases of 25 in the freezer ready to go  Service was nice and prompt even with such a big order right near the end of business  And most importantly my customers were happy  I received lots of compliments on the quality and there wasnt a single sausage left at the end of the day although I did spy a few halfeaten greasy frozen burgers that had been abandoned  So for the quality the location and the serviceBavaria Sausage Kitchen has earned their five stars  A few minor details  Thanks to Daniel K for the recommendation  The BSK website looks a little garish but his comment got me over that  Also let me say BSK has TONS of other products  We talking cold cuts salami bacon cured pork concoctions cheeses dry goods and what appears to be the largest collection of imported Haribo German original brand of gummi candy anywhere outside of Germany  I wont lie I took a couple packs to snack onSupport local I love this place and they have a special showing of all their shows I think at least once a month called Pay What You Can Night  Thats just icing on the cake  I went here last night with my girlfriend and our friends and I wasnt really looking for anything fantastic in terms of talent or venue  Boy was I surprised  Maybe not so much in terms of the venue but the talent was superb  The staff and opening host of the show were super friendly  The place really has a grass roots feel to it and I love itI would suggest anyone to come check out a show here and support this local theateryeah its true alright though it is cramped and messy and the old dude is grumpy he has a heart of gold and this place is one of the very best like best on earth I always seem to go in frustrated and leave happy this is likely a combination of the fact that I go with a broken bike that leaves fixed and the fact that the cost of fixing is soreasonable I recently replaced my brakes and the ones the old guy gave me were missing a screw so he upgraded me to the next nicer ones for free this guy is really a treasure and this place is too I look forward to the next bike repair because this place is so unabashedly wonderfulI love this place They always welcome you and do such great work I have had my eyelash extensions done there and the best I have found Love the nails I get done as well This place is become family to me  They do so much more than just nailsSaturday night at Salutes is a real treat  The live jazz duo sings quietly and adds to the ambience of this local gem  The staff is always friendly and makes some reference to your last trip which makes you feel special  And speaking of specialtheir chicken florentine special was mouthwatering  Im sure the bottle of Chianti helpedbut just LOVED the experienceThis place was totally empty and they still would not allow me to race with my son Said it was corporate policy on weekends We will never be back as I dont do business with stupid companies Hopeful the business that replaces Pole Position after it closes will uses more intelligenceMy favorite French restaurant in the world Beef flanksteak is amazing as well as all the appetizersThis place has the best selection of music in the downtown radius  Scratch that the best selection in Madison period  I dont mean the have the most music just the best of the best  And their 50 cent1 vinyl selection is pretty fun to browse through  The owner seems like a pretty cool guy as well which is nice because hes honest and not always trying to sell me up on something unlike the creep at Strictly Discs  They have a convenient drop box for 4 Star Video too which is handy now that I live on Willy St  Hey kids stop all the downloading  Support your local record shopWhat a wonderful place Craig runs So happy we chose to stay at The Parsonage for a girls weekend to MadisonThe highlights Location While the BB is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison its very easy to get to The perk of being off the beaten path is well being off the beaten path  Price The three of us chose the top floor Reverends Retreat which can actually sleep up to 6 It had the feel of your parents attic but in a good comfortable way For the Friday  Saturday night it was about comparable to what we wouldve paid to stay at a fancypants place in Madison Food Oh my goodness can Craig cook The breakfasts alone wouldve been worth 20person at a restaurant Definitely try the juice blend  you wont look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again  The company On the weekend we were there we late 20searly 30s had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see  do in Madison And Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs If youre in town definitely look up  consider The ParsonageI love Petes I know I know  you eat outside you have to order tartar sauce and they only take cash I love the food anyway Ive gone to Petes since I was born I love the red sauce that comes with the fish  it has a little bite to it I only wish they would expand north Im addicted to PetesI hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful There were a few customer service issues I had that Id like to mention so that others are aware 1 I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1800 number on the website I have a military ID and requested the military discount I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival Unfortunately when I arrived the girl at the checkin counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate that I could only have two of them I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted Bad way to start a fun occasion2 I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting iPod player Microwave Fridge Early Checkin I was told these things would be ready and they were not We never got the iPod player Microwave or Fridge Bad customer service TracyNOW Id like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center 1 Very clean and modern I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography2 The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle3 Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price Ive been told he has the hookup so make sure you get with him if you need anything special 4 Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE Are you serious FREE He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm We very happily toned it down by that point The stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great I really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event specialUnfortunately the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues We sat down and put in our drink order  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her Then the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one Anyway long story short it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar We will not be backReally great bubble tea And My favorite shake is the Pumpkin Chai Shake which is limited time every year SOOO good and made with real pumpkinGreat food Got a coupon off Groupon to try this place  yummy is all I can saydelicious food with a menu with something for everyone Had the fried plantains and bean dip as appetizer  great change of pace from chips and salsa The main courses were phenomenal and the rice pudding was the best ever Try it Little pr icy but very good and unique food  wonderful wonderful servicethis place is great but i am partial to anywhere that offers outside dining possibilities actually its only outside dining picnic tables to be exactthe Farm is just that with an attached lunch counter to get chicken salad sandwiches with pecans both fresh from on site Tons of tall shady trees picnic tables and wandering ducks and birds to delight the kiddiesHorrible dark dirty place bad service totally inauthentic food Anyone who thinks this is good Med food was born raised and lived in Apache Junction their entire  lifeI love this place It brought back so many Wisconsin memories since that is where I grew up We had the  Brandy old fashion sweet They make a good one and we had the fish fry yummm Many a Friday night was spent at the local fish fry places when we lived there The crowning touch was a brandy alexander They dont make them with ice cream any where but in Wisconsin to die forJims completely rocks John part owner  tall friendly guy behind the counter will take time to talk with you about your wants  needs and will special order anything you wish I say this because he did it for me many times over the years that I lived walking distance from the store Their fresh Amish turkeys are the best you can get for Thanksgiving You do need to order those in advance however If you dont see what youre looking for in the display case just ask He would custom cut a chunk of center sirloin for me  he always had a primal in stock not frozen He would let me hang out in the lobby and talk meat on Saturday mornings between customers I wanted to help out behind the counter just to learn from the team but they hire young people to work the counter and I couldnt take a job as a hobby that someone else needed to get thru school etc Long story short  If you likelove meat but cant tell a ribeye from a strip this is the place to go They will help you make a decision and how to treat the meat if need be Remember  the only stupid question is the one that never gets asked You neednt worry that you will be looked down upon if you ask a novice grilling question This is not a pretentious boutique Its a friendly helpful business that truly values your business and they will help you make some killer meatInattentive staff  Dirty tables I agree with the other reviews here  I think the Manager only hires other smokers and they spend 90 of their time sitting outside smoking instead of being prepared to serve customers  I go there because sometimes its convenient bc of the location but last week they left their AC broken for over a week in 80 degree weather  No additional fans nothingThen when it was fixed I went in ordered coffee and an order of hummuscarrotcelery prepackaged  Not only was the hummus watery from sitting in that container for several days but the celery was rotting at the ends yes brown and rotting  I showed the kid working there who was probably jonesing to have his next cigarette and I asked for another one  Without opening it I could see at least 23 of the other servings of hummus were also all watery and had celery that was starting to rot just like the one I was given  I asked for my money back  You know what was the worst thing though  The kid he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service put the containers with the watery rotting celery back in the case to serve to other unsuspecting customers  Hello Allegheny County Health DepartmentThen the ultimate insult 2 kids came in selling candy bars  Ive seen this there before but this time I said to them You know this is a business you shouldnt be here  Well the older of the 2 girls probably 1112 at most  where is her mother put her hands on her hips and said in a smartass tone We asked da owner we is allowed ta be hereWell that coffee I spent 2 on  That is the last money I will spend in that place  DisgustingOkay these guys are really good guys they provided free bike tuneups along the MS 150 route if you guys are familiar with that I had an issue with my ride within 200 miles of riding and brought it in and they only charged me for partsno labor I really appreciate their demeanor and customer service they provided to me I never get a pretentious dbag attitude when I come hereMy mother has been at four different rehab centers in Las Vegas over the past 1 12 yearsand for the last several months we have been at TLC We could not be happier with the service staff and environment There is always a doctor on staff which is very hard to find in a rehabthe nurses are very knowledgeable courteous and attentiveand have been dedicated to giving my mother consistent attention I would highly recommend this facility to anyone who deeply cares about where their loved one is placed We cant be grateful and thankful enoughHaving passed this place more than once while driving around Id always wanted to stop by but never made it much of a priority Well I stumbled across reviews here and due to the raving about the papusas I HAD to stop inMy partner in crime was kind enough to accompany me and as soon as we did we too joined the pupusa bandwagon mmm pupusa bandwagon drools We had the appetiser sampler which is good to share but might leave you wanting the another pupusa Im a fan of the chicken soup you get but just wish the serving size was slightly biggerThe appetizer comes with 3 different items and all are equally tastey ref pupusa They also give you some cabbage salad and a tomato sauce to accompany the items yumMy gf ordered the recommended chicken dish and lurved the hell out of it I agreed and actually was wishing Id gotten that instead of the Salvadorian marinated steak which was good but paled in comparison to the chickenSidenotes Try the ensalada drink its a sweet fruit based drink that comes with slices of apple Sort of reminds me of drinking a melted otter pop which as far as Im concerned is off the proverbial chain Also served with appetiser and as a sidedish with the food was a bean soup which was good and great for dipping the tortillas in Oh and the tortillas are Salvadorian style meaning thick and sort of along the lines of a Mexican gordita I could eat these for daysPupusas drools give me a towel boy droolsI stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel IHG brand  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee it is unavoidable in the center of the cityAt least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist I wish I remembered her name  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel and I truly believe it Our room was 15th floor room 1534  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows one side had a great view of uptown not the arena which is behind the hotel and the ceilings were over 12 feet high Our king bed was comfy as always and I always fall asleep quickly on themThe hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people  It is located one block from the Epicenter and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 35 miles to go to an auditorium we saw Wicked and it was fantastic  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown  In the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels  For anybody looking into hotels I suggest you sign up for their rewards system whether or be this one priority club or another chains version of it  Hotels reward loyalty and will do a lot to keep you loyal  We did our research and liked the IHG brand everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinentalfor a few reasons they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points and pricewise they stay competitive  Our room preferences are already saved to our account free to create  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs then stick to it  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year they will do a little more to keep you happy and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me at no additional cost  The room was only 97 and that really cant be beat  for this locationI LOVE this restaurant So far I have only been twice but boy I wish I could afford to go weekly My boyfriend and I just went for Valentines Day Had a reservation got there a little early and were still seated immediately and in the jazz room too Side note the female singer they had on Valentines was INCREDIBLE Wish I got her name My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone possibly the best rolls Ive had at any restaurant For my drink I ordered the chocolate martini my favorite Oh and of course a Hurricane later also deliciousFor my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping OH First let me mention the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING I dont care if its not authentic Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like Slow down its not going anywhere It had a little bit of a kick to it which I dont normally like but the flavor was just too good Now back to the entree Last time I ordered the same thing but I didnt even try the crawfish topping I just gave it all to my mom This time however I realized what a mistake that was Ive actually never had crawfish before so I have nothing to compare theirs to but it was delicious and Im already craving more The tilapia like the first time was also todiefor I will admit Im biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping as did IUnfortunately neither of us were able to leave room for dessert so I have nothing to say about that Overall this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now The only problem is the parking which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there Its such a tiny place with barely any parking but Id rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location The tiny old building along with the jazz music playing makes me feel like Ive gone back in time Its such a cozy romantic restaurant Definitely a great choice for Valentines Day and even my extremely picky highmaintenance boyfriend I love him but he is agreed Believe me he wasnt lying He wouldnt hesitate to tell me if I picked a bad restaurant lolFriendly stafftons of great ideas and products  I came here after a disappointing experience at Archivers in the same mall  From now on Ill happily come here insteadIve been to this place probably 30 times and it never ceases to have the tastiest drinks and friendliest bartenders in all of Scottsdale Meredith Steven Fernando and Mike will make you a consistently delicious drink each and every time no matter what your taste buds crave Theyre also hilarious and will have you smiling through each tasty libation Be sure to check out the black raspberry martini and ask for the limelight Feeling hungry The chicken lettuce wraps are amazing You wont be disappointedFirst of all Johnny Chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef He is barely a line cook As stated in previous reviews he doesnt even taste his own food which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visitsSo I made reservations thinking I may be able to sit at the bar because I arrived 10 minutes early Wrong I was ordered to wait outside Nearly 45 minutes later and a drink at the bar next door I inquired about my table The girl didnt even look up at me to acknowledge I had said anything After a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me she finally said my table was ready HmmThe food is horrible I fear those of you who enjoy it rather enjoy the atmosphere and come here to be seen The food is either completely bland eg my curry which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldnt even recognize or so hot as to mask any possible flavor By calling themselves authentic Asian cuisine is just silly There are so many holeinthewall Asian restaurants that could cook Chu under the table blindfoldedSo the rude nonexistent service the insanely overpriced food and to be seen is what youre paying for If you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that I wouldnt feed in a troth for pigsyou may enjoy this place and good for youFantasic and very friendly staff The best in Charlotte hands downThe only complaintmake a reservation and by far the food is well worth the wait  I have never went to Japanese where noodles and rice was served with your meal Vegetables included carrots mushrooms the norm zucchini and onions  The staff was great The food was excellentWent here for eyelash extensions and they were absolutely horrifying There was so much glue it ruined my own eyelashes They literally started falling off before I even got home I looked like a clown I was hysterical My husband went back down there and spoke with them eyelashes in hand and they refused to refund the money paidShe would reapply them I have no lashes to attach them too DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE They dont care about a happy customer they care about the moneySMAC was a wonderful dojo for our family My son was there through his purple belt my daughter through blue We spent many many hours there and I cannot sing their praises enough I appreciate all of the teachers especially Sensei Tyler and Sensei Ray They are patient yet firm Their traditional dojo is the real dealAfter years of practicing there when my son decided to leave the dojo to try something else he went to Sensei Ray to talk to him about it Ray was gracious and encouraging to my 10 year old son It made all the difference in the world That is the type of outstanding character Sensei Ray has My son still remembers what they talked about and knows the door is open for him to come back anytimeGreat safe and cool place Every kind of dancer you can imagineThis place is great Now I would like to qualify my 5 stars These strip mall nail salons usually suck so bad that 1 star is too many That being said as a strip mall nail salon goes this place is topnotch But dont go expecting some amazing 5 star spa you wont get it What you will get is a clean sanitized friendly staff The guy did my pedicure and it was one of the best Ive ever had My feet  calves were so sore from ballet and now  they feel great I got gels done and I will say they arent really set up to do gel toes they are for hands I wish they had the UV light a little more convenient for feet I had to get up each time but otherwise a very pleasant experience for a very stressed womanI agree this is a wonderful place to buy cheese  Anywhere else in Pittsburgh and I do mean TJs and Whole Foods as well as Giant Eagle your cheese is likely to taste like the plastic it is wrapped in  At Penn Mac its not only the best in town its beyond excellent  In price freshness quality selection  You can buy half pounds despite what the sign says  I always did  I also think the nuts are a great deal  and the spices  Worth the trek from whatever neighborhood you live in or from your downtown workplace  If you have a car they do have limited parking in back  And some of the nicest flowers in Pittsburgh are sold out front too  Holiday seasons and weekends this place is a bit nuts but I went regularly yearround maybe every 2 weeks and totally relied on this placeFoodies visiting Pittsburgh especially if youre staying in the Convention Center area should definitely check out the Strip for shopping and snacksKevin and Glen were spectacular  I bought my friend a ride for her birthday and she was gracious enough to bring me along  It was totally worth it  The crew was very friendly and extremely knowledgable on hot air balloons  I was a bit nervous but it was all put to ease because these guys were entertaining and professional  If I get up the gumption to do this again I will definitely go with these guys The four person balloon seemed much nicer than those larger balloons considering it was just me and my friend going  We met a very nice couple too that joined us in the balloon  Kevins stories were great and he knew so much  Definitely give these guys a try its worth every pennyVery disappointedI had my usual Dirty martini but a friend wanted just a soda since she was drivingDo you know what they charged400  For a soda  And it was in the smallest glass  Come onWith DUI laws that we have here in Scottsdale and the economy crisis that we are in  400 for a soda is a bit much when it is cheaper at Target to get a case  350 I am not cheap by any stretch but I think it is a bit absurd to over inflate the price of a soda  Dont go to Stone Rose if you are looking for a drink dealBeautiful littel chapel not a Church this facility is now only used for Weddings and it is pretty good idea and location for that small chapel with large grounds and the weather was great for photos i was a little hurt that i was not shooting my first wedding then later releaved and glad my friend and yeas he is a jock of course explained that his brides mom needed to be the one to chose the photographer i gleamed so ideas from himback to the review this place does have that Historic look and fell to it and the cordinator was cool as she could be for our group or one half of to be so disorganized bet she did not plan on being a zookeeper that day she remained as calm as ive seen so she gets high marks totightly scheduled for a party known for lateness not me a caught a ride with the puncual few wich means the groom picked me up ok they give you more than enough time if you get there on time ive said too much about my friends wife and her familymmmuhwhat about the honeymoon good question and i do not want to know my friend is 19 and his bride is in her 20s so they could have stayed in Matthews or Pineville and saved some monetthanks to everyone for liking my reviews im backI always take my golf visiting buddies to this BEAUTIFUL golf course  Yes its a little further out but its well worth the drive  Immaculate course great layout  terrific service  Troon Golf should send this team to Troon North  to teach the boys at TNa little about how to deliver great customer service My favorite public course in AZ  2  Dove mountain  3  Boulders South  Sorry Troon North   You need to improve service at every level to make your way back to the top inspite of your beautiful coursesAs far as wine and cheese bars go  this place has Postinos beat by a long shot  The wine list is impressive  The staff can make recommendations on the fly  The owner actually takes his staff to visit vinyards so they become familiar with the wines  The food is out of this world  but unpretentious   You dont have to travel to Scottsdale to get fine food and drink  weve got it right here in Central Phoenix at Cheuvront   With that said  try the Macaroni and Cheese  which is what I tried tonight  out of this world albeit a little spicy  Ive eaten there three times and have yet to try a desert because Im so stuffed from the fabulous cheese selection and wine  My new favoriteGreat great for parties and celebrations of all kinds  The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable of the menu and the wine list  The Food is creative and many of the items are organic or locally grown  Everything is so fresh and pretty you almost dont want to eat it  The wine list is extensive and although it can be pricey they have great happy hour specialsThe Glass Center is a marvelous addition the Pittsburgh cultural scene  They are a gallery a place to take classes a center for glass artists in residence and much more  Whether you are taking a tour a class or visiting the gift shop or gallery theres a lot to see and learn here  Ive taken tours several times with different groups but I always learn something new and I am always impressed by the great work takes place at the CenterThey will take students at every level  Their facility is well run and professionally staffed  I was delighted to meet their enthusiastic staffTheres a hot shop a cold shop a flame shop and a gallery so theres lots to see and learnBeauty Secrets by Heather is the place to go if you want fantastic lashes  Expect to be complimented like never before just from one visit  I have to say I am hooked and cannot do without my lashes  I can go to work now without makeup and the look she gives is natural and inexpensive compared to most  Heather is a skilled professional who wants you to be satisfied with your lashes I have recommended her to all my friends as she provides a comfortable relaxing experience  Love Heather and my lash extensionsOur son Jacob has been attending Ricos Martial Arts for 4 12 years sincehe was 3 years old We feel that because of being a part of this RMAfamily that Jacob has become extremely mature for a 7 year old and haslearned to appreciate all types of people despite their age or abilityThe students at this studio range from 3 to adult and all have a mutuallove and respect for each other It is truly a family My husband and Iconsider Mr and Mrs Rico to be second parents to Jacob over the yearsas in times of trial they have shared in helping us set goals andconsequences for our son and they provided another solid example forhim to follow of what is right and wrong The children learn disciplinehonor integrity and the importance of helping others and doing well inschool I highly recommend this martial arts studio to anyoneThis place is GREAT Got rid of some jewelry I never wear and they got me the beat price for it Plus they had a variety of items for sale The staff was friendly and you can tell that the manager Johnny definitely takes pride in his staff and store Wonderful experienceHow does this place stay in business Its never a good shopping experience here and Ive never seen it busy Coming here I feel as if Im raiding the owners personal collection Youre not allowed to browse and he will frequently tell you soOne time I asked the owner to order something for me and he REFUSED because he would only make 1 off it So I went to GMart and they ordered it for me insteadConversations with the owner are bound to be interesting  like the fact that he wants to have a funeral pyre when he dies  but most people I know are made uncomfortable by going there Apparently our two kinds of geek do not meshGMart has a better selection and the employees are helpful and funnyYoud be forgiven for walking straight past the entrance to this place tucked down a flight of steps just off George Street but in my opinion thats half of its charm Its popular and highlyregarded without needing to shout about it people know about it because of the quality not because its in your faceIts easy to see why When you step inside its like being on some sort of Japanese garden terrace with the green leafy plants and water feature Ricks pay great attention to detail every table has a copy of that mornings newspaper neatly folded on it next to the fresh flowers and the service is efficient without being annoying and intrusiveAlthough its never going to make the Top 10 list of cheapest places in Edinburgh you do get what you pay for That said at the moment all of the Montpeliers venues have their Better By Half promos on glasses of house wine selected cocktails selected beers and even champagne by the glass are all half price at the moment Ive been making the most of these offers every time Im out for fear that they might finish soon but despite my panicdrinking it seems theyre here to stay for a whie yet Happy DaysIve only ever drunk here but one of these days I will be going for food the plates Ive seen being carried to other tables do look and smell gorgeous There are always enough people in here to give the place a nice buzz but never enough to make it the kind of busy where service starts to slump and the temperature goes through the roofThis place is truly a gem of the east valley First of all its cheaper than cheap Secondly and most importantly they have the most amazing selection of LOCALLY grown produce Oh my god it makes me so happy Im probably going to cry I asked the owners how they keep their prices so reasonable and they said its because they work with farmers that dont sell at the local farmers markets but want to sell their produce nonetheless What they cant get locally due to season or unavailability they have from other states They also carry homemade tortillas kettle corn honey and salsas all local I absolutely love this place If you cant get to the Farmers Markets or live too far like me you have to check this place outI am a loyal customer of Cobblestone Nail Studio for more than 13 years When I lived in the west valley I traveled 40 miles one way to have my nail services performed Cobblestone is truly the best nail studio of its class The atomosphere at the studio is fun and the customers are treated like family The owner Su is awesome I highly recommend this establishmentMatt was great i love american stich 2 needles upHavent been to the doctor in 5 or 6 years so I thought I would go and get checked out  My insurance covers preventative care 100 and I have a large deductible for sick visits  I went had no health complaints and the nurse told me I was the healthiest person she had seen all dayThe practice then billed a sick visit code to my insurance which applied 130 to my deductible  I called the billing number explained the situation and asked that they bill the prevantative visit code to my insurance  The billing person told me the doctors pick the code not the billing people but he would check with the doctor and call me back the next dayHe never called  I left two voicemails for the billing guy which he never returnedI appealed to my insurance who denied because the doctor used a sick visit codeSooo my doctor is still sending me bills for the prevantative visit that is covered 100 by my insurance  The office is yet to explain the problem of medium to high severity described is the CPT code  The only diagnosis billed is V700 adult well visitThis post is probably more about the billing dept but still makes me madDont go to this salon  They not only did a terrible job but they were rude and charged a lot for the service they provided  The place looked ok when you first walk in but once you sit in the chair you notice their trays are dirty and they dont use clean sterile tools  The male tech that did my pedicure didnt speak English didnt clean out the nail bed to prepare it to be painted and painted the nails getting the polish on the skin  This place was a waste of time and money  Im very surprised the health department didnt shut them down yetThis place is amazing Jim is a great artist Traveled all the way from Tampa just to get my tattoo I would recommend this place to everyoneWent in for a couple drinks and food It was so slow that I actually asked one of the employees if they were closing With that being said drinks came out pretty fast but that was it waited about 15 minutes for the bartender to take our order which we cashed out and moved on to another place to eat There were more employees in the restaurant than guests and ironically there were a couple of them enjoying a meal at a table in the Dining room in front of customers who couldnt even order an appetizer in a reasonable time No management present that we could see Seems like a place that has given upWhy did it take us so long to discover Old Time It is amazing I will never buy meat or fish at the supermarket again I particularly like the knowledgeable staff the smell of BBQ and the extensive range of high quality products they sell The best beef I have seen outside of Texas and New ZealandOne of my all time favorite places to eat in VEGAS  Way off the strip its best to come to Swish when its not peak eating hours  The first time I came here I arrived right about the time they opened  This turned out to be a good thing  By the time my friends and I were finishing up with our leisure lunch the place was filling up quickly and nicelyThe layout is waaay cool  A large U shaped counter sits in the middle of the room  Sitting out the outer edges your server will provide you with a gas grill and give you your choice of shabu shabu or sukiyaki  Or loosely translated  wet soupy or dry meal grilled  You get to swish your food yourself  If you give a stupid enough look your server might be as sympathetic as mine and help you out with the cooking  Luckily Ive done this before so no stupid looks here  At least not in regards to getting my cook onThe average plate is slightly price but it is well worth it  The owner and staff are awesome and friendly  I try to hit up Swish whenever I get the chance  You should tooIm not really a big club guy maybe its because Im not a player or is it playa  I can never keep track of what the kids say these days  I hate lines I hate cover charges and I hate 12 drinks that should be 6 On this night I didnt have to worry about these things thanks to a friend of a friend of a friend who got us in without waiting and without a cover we were more than happy to give him a nice tip though  So we walk past the line and Im feeling like Wayne and Garth holding up their backstage passes in Waynes WorldWe get up to Moon and Im thinking Maybe I should change my whole anticlub attitude This place was great  awesome music some outdoor space with amazing views of Vegas and one floor down the Playboy Club  a casino that features Playboy bunnies as dealers  Did I mention that Im also not much of a gambler  Im thinking that might be changing as wellLifetime sells the spa as an incentive to the gym along with the kids play area The customer service at the spa was horrendous today Jilian at lifetime spa has hands down worst customer service I have experienced in a long time  Canceling appt eye rolling deep breathing to convey her frustrations Dont work with ppl if you do not like the publicGreat service I used them for a classic car restoration 5 years ago and all my parts I sent to Powder Coating Plus are still in great shape  Their attention to detail and service are great  Adam was very easy to work withI love Christos I recommend the pomodoro pasta It is so light fresh and delicious Christos is ny favoriteMy boyfriend and I made a trip to Wisconsin Dells for my birthday and stopped here on the way back to Chicago to get some cheese All of the employees here were extremely helpful and friendly Cheese was decent priced and delicious Id recommend itAwesome local meat market Nice selection incredibly friendly staff  great dealsI read a few negative reviews from other unhappy customers but I thought I would try this place out anyway When I arrived my wife and I met Alladin shop owner who seemed very confident He said he worked with pro athletes and sounded like he knew what he was talking about He tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money Later I purchased an 800 Hugo Boss suit and came back to see him to have it altered He made all of the necessary markings and pinned the back of the jacket to be altered A week later I came with my wife to pick up the suit and he handed me the wrong suit good thing I checked He didnt ask me to try the right one on so I asked if I could make sure it fit Long story short he never altered the jacket and the pants seam was off He tried to charge 200 for doing nothing to the jacket which is a scam He finally agreed to fix the jacket so sent us to lunch and made some adjustments He didnt know how to work with the modern Hugo Boss material and you could see the stitching marks from the hem on the outside of the pants legs  WHAT A JOKE I was going to seek legal advice but figured I would spend more on a lawyer than just making the ruined suit work If you need anything complicated done or if you are have anything of value do not use this guy PLEASE BEWARE and dont ignore these complaints like I did There are other negative reviews out there if you lookBeautiful shop  My husband  I have gone to Felice the owner for over 20 years  This is a new location for her shop   Good service you wont be disappointedPutting aside the fact that when i first went they had some bad impressions owner on vacation closed shop for over a week no ingredients to make ice cream to replenish stock etc If i based the review on that only id probably give them 12 stars But i gave them many chances to recoverLocated on the SW corner of Tropicana and Ft Apache next door to Tropical Smoothie take note the address from yelp on more than one occassion has led the person to the area down the street Easy way to get to this place would be turning right at the Hobby Lobby sign on Ft apache and then taking a left I had first heard about this place from a friend saying they had durian ice cream i was ecstatic to hear this news and been waiting a LONG time to try this place There are 3 different areas of ice cream First is the normal type containing like chocolate banana chocolate pistachio etc Second is the asian type containing green tea lychee taro black sesame ginger mango durian and guava Last but not least something catered to the lactose intolerant 100 nondairy ice cream with flavors of i believe vanilla chocolate and mango All the ice cream is made by the owner himself Peter Wong He lets you try as many flavors as you want and he gives you a decent amount way more than other places for samples Something good to note is all the ice creams are not overly sweet They are sweet but very fragrant All of the ice cream are soft and very smooth Ive tried most of the asian flavors including some of the normal and one of the nondairy style Starting by my favorite type asian flavors  My least favorite is probably the ginger There is a slight spice from the ginger that you can taste Nothing spicy but its like a subtle but noticeable spice The taro is one of the lighter ones as well Fragrant  light with very small taro bits No artificial coloring not deep purple like you see in stores but like very very light purpleThe mango and lychee are nice Sweeter but fragrant depending on the fruit The guava new is nice Really fragrant not too sweet Out of the ordinary asian flavored ice cream The last two is black sesame and durian so i just noticed ive never tried green tea hmm first the black sesame Made with actual ground black sesame VERY fragrant Slightly sweet Its like the ice cream version of the hot black sesame soup dessert i love it  And last but not least durian BE WARNED this is one of the asian fruits where you either will love it or hate it It has a very distinct flavor and smell This is my favorite along with the black sesame the durian has a light yellow color Gives off the actual durian fragrance that youd expect from the fruit Same for the taste as well Very fragrant slightly sweet As for the normal flavors i havent had the chance to try yet ive been stuck on the asian flavors but when i visited today Peter let me try a new creation of his which was the banana chocolate chip He said its made with real bananas  this flavor was really fragrant in terms of the banana not too sweet either Honestly almost rather prefer it without the chocolate chip the chocolate chip makes it kind of weird Now last but not least something a lot of places dont offer 100 nondairy ice cream When i had first visited this place my uncle was complaining about not being able to try any because of his lactose intolerance Luckily Peter just created that day something new 100 non dairy ice cream My uncle was super happy Peter was very careful made sure to not use a scoop that was prior used in the other ice creams As i had said earlier there was 3 flavors he had made When he was getting a sample for my uncle he said the ice cream was made earlier and has not completely set yet but because its been maybe 12 hours since freezing process started there are some areas he was able to get that was solidified I forgot which flavor was tasted but the texture and flavor was good Of course its not as fragrant as if using normal dairy products but it was still good for what it is Flavorful semi sweet and of course smooth Highly recommended place for ice cream Prices are very good as wellStarting at 250 for 1 scoop up to 550 for 4 scoops They arent small scoops either  DAfter reading glowing reviews on Yelp I decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport Service was great Driver was very courteous and on time We used them to pick her up at the airport and are equally happy The driver even carried her suitcases upstairs to her apartmentUmFUN And affordable Took my 4 year old nephew here to ride the fast race cars and he loved it The go cart track is fun as can be and the 2 person go carts even had a second steering wheel that he could pretend to use other go carts dont always have the second wheel and he is very serious about steering Anywhoo we also did the bumper boats and those were just as damn fun Wait times in line were nil and prices are cheap I highly recommend this place Cant wait to go againI was traveling for work and stayed at the Hilton so figured I would check Fujo out Great service and really delicious sushi The prices were very reasonable and the portions were large I got a spicy tuna roll always good and a volcano roll and they were so good I also got a rainbow martini which was yummy Ill definitely go back when I travel to CharlotteIve never seen so many old shoes in all my lifeIf I could give less then one star I would  Horrible service  The waitress greeted us by  saying what can I get you There was no hello welcome or anything of the sort  Epic fail  The place was very dimly lit which always makes me a little uneasy  I like to be able to see what is going on especially if Im consuming food  There was trash on the floor and it just was not my cup of tea  Needless to say we did not stay  Will never returnIve been reading yelp for two years now and its been our guide on picking restaurants and what have you I trusted the review 90 of the time wc is pretty good My personal experience with this establishment yesterday was unpleasant Walked in yesterday late afternoon to try this place and theres a family on one table enjoying their ice cream and two Chinese female in their early twenties who wear a hoochie mama type of clothing ahead of me ordering  The Chinese dude in his 50s taking orders is somewhat extra nice to these 2 which is fine suggesting to sample all the diff type of ice cream When female one ordered he asked female 2 about what she wants and she said she didnt want any The Chinese counter guy said  oh u shouldve tasted more free samples while u were waiting my point is when it was our turn my daughter tried one flavor of ice cream and when she wants to try another flavor the guy had this annoyed look and said  I can let her try another flavor but I need to scoop the ice cream  drop it to to her USED PLASTIC SPOON What a rude ass  He said its a waste to give my daughter a new spoon Thats the 1st reasons why they scored one2nd  while hes about to do my Boba the family whos about to leave decided to order some soda the bastard stop and took their freaking order Not sure if I have the look of a PUSH OVER but I know my face doesnt look friendly anymoreLast the register broke The dude was now clueless on what to do so the family who were paying for the soda helped him to figure out what they oweAfter 20 minutes of hell and mistreatment he can probably tell Im about to explode and let him have it He gave me a scoop of ice cream to top my Boba for the inconvenience and I can tell from his face he dont really wants to do thisTo be honest the wait doesnt bother me but the fact that this perv was ALL nice and giddy to these young hoochie female and he wants us to re use our freaking plastic spoon the its reason of the 1 star Their Boba by the way is just 2 stars Id rather go to Cefiore down the road or better yet Fresh cup in chinatown Btw The red bean Boba is so badwe drove straight to Human Bean and got Snowy Mocha instead I know its not Boba but were almost home so I got coffee insteadThe 7 ounce house sirloin is the bomb Nuff saidAwesome trip Highly recommend We did a private ride just the two of us for anniversary during sunset So beautiful and exciting By far our best anniversary yet Thanks Dar for a great rideTai Chi with Kim Kubsch is so beneficial to my health plus relaxing for my mind and body As Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical School report Tai Chi is more effective and has fewer dangers or side effects than almost any other form of exercise Kims two easy and gentle Tai Chi DVDs are excellent to use at home or on vacation to ensure my balance and coordination stay strong everyday  KA ArizonaI went here today to have dim sum with my friend and it was end up uncomfortable We sit there for 15 and nobody came to ask anythings After the foods were brought out we asked 3 waitresses for the sauce and had nothing Then i asked the waiter again and he brought it w unhappy face and through the dish in front of us We order 5 dishes but they brought out only four When we finished and checked out one of them told me we still have shrimp ball is making and that was 45 after we ordered it I didnt want it anymore When i paid i didnt put the tip in my card and he came to our table to check if we put the tip on the table What the heck Should i leave the tip for the service we hadThis place is great Like all the other reviews you must mention Steve Honest nice approachable and incredibly helpful I used to buy a lot of my stuff online thinking I was getting a better deal some cases it was true However in reality I started doing a comparison With shipping costs we cant get everything off of Amazon wait time quality and the ease of accessibility Youre actually better off going here The cost is comparable if not better here ALSO did I mention Steve and his RAD factor Seriously youre supporting a local business which if you live here you know how important that is AND you get the benefit of objective knowledge and information about cool beer and wine events This is a great resource for a guy who is passionate about what he does and he deserves our supportAlso I want to note the selection of inventory is very decent as well His inventory is always changing and fresh Nothing seems to sit on the shelves for too long Steve has never tried to up sell me on anything and always provides me with insightful options to improve my beerIn a last ditch attempt at exhibiting what may be the last shred of virility within my being I took one of my vintage Robert Graham shirts to BrothersI did so after my wife plucked it from the Goodwill pile reasoning how these folks can fix anything and how I shouldnt give away such an expensive party shirt I agreedAnd now I have a vintage Robert Graham shirt hanging in my closet Just hanging thereWaitingfor the day when my wife says something like        Hey wanna go clubbing tonightI have a feeling it may have to go back to Brothers a few more times in its hanging careerwhile my weight changes like Im a finalist in the Duncan YoYo tournamentThis was the most amazing and authentic Ice Cream Parlor I have ever been too  Really it gets the biggest points for being authentic  The decor is oldschool 1920s style wood paneled booths old telephone cubbies a beautiful marble ice cream bar and bar stools with the seats shaped like soda caps  The walls are lined with glass drug store display cases  now filled with an assortment of glass ware and interesting ice cream parlor related paraphernalia I heard about Klavons first while watching a WQED special on the strip district  When the special was filmed the second generation of owners the son and wife of the founders had recently passed away The parlor stayed closed for a few years according to my fiance So when I decided after the hot summer day that scorched Pittsburgh yesterday meant an ice cream run the fiance immediately had me check the hours for Klavons I was greatly surprised to find out that their summer hours go till 900pm on Sundays YAY  we had enough time to get there and enjoy the ice creamThe place was packed with I would guess around 20 to 30 people awaiting or enjoying their ice cream The ops are so efficient it didnt take long for them to whip up an extremely DELICIOUS Sunday called the Chocolate Delight So for atmosphere service and a AMAZING ice cream sunday  check out KlavonsIf you are looking for a no frills Friday night fish fry that will blow your mind this is your place I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal with excellent service  We had a little trouble finding the door the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables we were instantly greeted by our friendly server  Though the bar was busy we got our drinks immediately along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw  All very standard issue  The fish was another story Whoa  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly  It was buttery nonfishy and totally delicious  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard but good  The perch was battered differently in a thicker more crunchy coating  The little strips were just AMAZING  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldnt stop eating  The fries were done to perfection as well  My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye the bartender wished us a good night and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon  I cant say enough about how friendly everyone here is  It looks like a burned out biker bar but their simple menu is done right  I never thought I would like a place so much that doesnt have salad on their menu but I anticipate we will be back many many more timesThis location is isolated for being by the light rail We stopped by on a Sunday at noon There were no other customers at the time The establishment is very clean and ventilated The style has character and thankfully does not clutter the walls with kitchy decorations The staff is very friendly as well as attentive We ordered fried calamari rings and catfish shrimp combos with drinks The prices are very reasonable although there was a discrepancy on the chalk written price The fish is freshly battered on the spot and the food is cooked in a timely manner The batter and oil for each food item is specialized The calamari rings were excellent with the marinara sauce They were not too crunchy and not too rubbery just perfect The catfish came in three long strips over steak fries three shrimp and sides of sauces Moist tender crunchy and packed with flavor is how I would describe both the catfish and butterfly shrimp The green tea reminds me of the imported teas in international markets in california We will order from this place for office lunches in the futureArt Lewin Besoke Clothiers a name synonymous with Luxury in Beverly Hills is now in Scottsdale  Doug Carlton the owner of this new Custom Clotherie in

 Great prices fantastic staff and knowledgeable staff important in this business  I love coming to this music store because they always seem to have what is needed and having three musicians in our house that is important  We recently took an instrument to be looked at for repair and the guy fixed it on the spot no charge Of course we ended up spending money in the store anyways so it was a winwin for Buchanan Music and myself  Ive me the owner a few times and hes always willing to work with me on prices and helped order me a personalized product once Highly recommendedTo be honest we stumbled across this place almost by accident and to top it off we almost missed the best part about the restaurant  There is a patio situated right onto Place Jacques Cartier however there is an open section behind the restaurant where a jazz quartet was playing  The food was really good  My wife had a crepe my sister also had a crepe not the same kind of course while I enjoyed an Italian pizza which I know as a Margarita pizza  We absolutely loved the atmosphere and sitting outside on a hot and humid Montreal evening drinking wine listening to live jazz  and eating great French food made this a real highlight of our tripI have been coming here for months with my girlfriend to come check out Barry Black and his crew including Preston both from the voice I came with my girlfriend sitting like always the manager came up and told us not to be us basically HOMOPHOBIC ASSS MANAGER DISGUSTED Barry and the crew should be playing elsewhere Its 2014 and hate and discrimination should not be tolerated Sorry not sorry that my lady and I are attractive lesbians Too bad We are close with the musicians  The bartenders are amazing and same with the hookah hosts The owner needs to burry a hole 6 feet under for herselfI am not quite sure what is wrong with all the people on this site giving this Restaurant high marks I went based upon those and was extremely disappointed  This was by far and away one of the worst meals I have had in recent memory The majority of my party felt ill afterwards I would give it 0 stars but Yelp doesnt allow thatAte here last night and it was absolutely the best meal I have had at Sushi Kim Wife got the usual pork bulgogi and I got standar dol sut bibimbap It was unbelievably good It wasnt because I was really hungry It was perfect Every single bit of both meals was perfectly proportioned and seasoned And the side dishes were GREAT except I really missed not having sweet potato and little omelet ban chan I will cut out Dosani and Korean Kitchen as long as Sushi Kim keeps this upTJ J has it spot on This place is the best I am just getting started with yoga and I cant imagine going anywhere else The classes are extremely small and consequentially not intimidating at all and the instructor and staff are delightful I have been to other places where yoga is a giant scary class with 40 other people which makes it sort of daunting to get startednot so here The personal attention and the good energy are unbelievable You will leave class feeling the best you ever have  Really do yourself a favor and check this place outMy favorite place in Madison Ive been there many times and its always a blast Ive never been disappointed I most recently saw Ben Kronberg and the show was amazing as always Great staff  great comedians and great drinksThis place has a great little vibe and fantastic music I have to admit Im not very hip when it comes to the Blues but I definitely enjoy listening to it when given the chance It was a nice change to look into the crowd and see 21yearold college students to middle age moms to retired couples all getting down and dancing You rarely see such an eclectic mix of people from every color of the rainbow and all ages just enjoying the music The few times Ive been there have been quite an experience and I always leave very happy to have found a place like this in Phoenix The drinks are super cheap the sound is good and the music is wonderfulSo we have had an ant in our drink watched bartenders touch peoples food and a bouncer refused to kick out a guy who showed His junk to girls Classiest place everI made my first trip to Brennans today and it was well worth the trip across town The fruit and veggies were absolutely beautiful and delicious They have signs indicating where the produce came from and little precut samples so you can taste how good everything is The Michigan blueberries they have in right now are heavenly The fresh bakery area smelled wonderful The meat counter is run by Jacobsons brother and had a deli case of typical salads and deli meats as well as fresh steaks pork and chicken I grilled up a small sirloin that tasted like summer There is also a fresh fish counter a lot of wine and a ton of cheese many of which you can sampleDr Riley has been my doc for 6 or 7 years now  When I first went to his office I was confused  There werent a ton of people in the waiting room  I didnt have to wait one hour in the waiting room and another hour in the room  As soon as Dr Riley walked in I started my speedrecitation of current symptoms  this because my previous MD actually would look at his watch and note the time  and then do it again at the end of the consult  Dr Riley listened calmly  I was confused again when he didnt just tell me I could pick up my prescription at the counter on my way out  He actually TALKED with me  He asked questions  He didnt make a mad dash for the door  Miraculous  And the good news is that this has not changed in all these years  I dont have insurance so Dr Riley works with me on that  He and his wife the staff everyone is great in this little gem of an office  Dr Riley is a real FAMILY doctor  he is always there for you  What more could you possibly ask forWhat a wonderful location  My sisters future MIL hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people we had our own private room  It was tastefully decorated and beautiful  The Inn on Negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there as wellThe tea room is simply gorgeous and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious  They even had a blue  yellow tea for us the brides wedding colors and I loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around  The food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot sconesWhat a lovely spot for afternoon tea and I look forward to returning again to Pittsburgh  may want to stay there next timeWay way overpriced Sure Vegas is expensive but this place goes beyond overpriced to obscenely overpriced and for just ok food Not much in way of veggie options and if you ask its a flat no you cant make any changes Tried to ask whether or not the vegetable roll had any meat or seafood in it I was met with vegetable roll and a weird totally fake smile But does it have any meat in it vegetable roll only a little louder with the fake smile Theres no meat in it vegetable roll Well that was helpful Never mind I dont need to be eating fried food anyways Food is also very salty I was dying of thirst for the rest of the dayMy Sisterinlaws mom forces her and my brother to take her to Knock Kneed Lobster every time she comes into town from Baltimore  We met up with them 2 piece fish and shrimp wchips  They even have pasta for the vegetarians  The Mizithra Cheese Pasta was WAY WAY WAY better than The Spaghetti Factory  We got a side of hush puppiesSOOOO YUMMY  WAY WAY WAY better than Petes Fish and Chips which is still goodThere is only 1 problem  no Diet Coke Pepsi products Cant miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in PittsburghYinz dont know what the hell youre talking about or order the wrong dish Do yourself a favor order the Lemon Chicken with seshwan sauce instead of lemon sauceThank my laterAfter having experiences from Laura and Lisa from the Brow Lady and awesome customer experience from both of them I am now sad to say nothing here is the same as it was before On my last visit I was scheduled with Sharmeita someone who had only been hired two days prior to my brow wax While she did an amazing job with my eyebrows she lacked in customer service She pretty much did everything wrong you could do while in a customer service position She gossiped about the people there the company drama and the company itself She even told me the rude things she would say to a customer if they asked a stupid question I would have been extremely happy if my waxer would have good customer service skills but unfortunately not and I will NEVER come back to this company AND I GAVE THIS PLACE SEVERAL CHANCES TO REDEEM ITSELF AFTER LISA AND LAURA LEFT Pleaseeee take heed if you are considering coming here there are much much much better places in Scottsdale that will treat you better than this place now I will definitely be following Lisa to her own shop nowGood food drinks and views  Great place to come by boat in the summerMeh I went here for an appointment with Anastasia for gel and glitter I waited patiently and ended up with an appointment with a completely different person than what I was told I was going to see I asked her I wanted gel with glitter and she had no idea what I was talking about She said she can do gel polish with glitter in it but not any type of loose glitter with gel The lady they gave me only does regular acrylic nails and was even too afraid to do the glitter as she didnt know what she was doing Finally another lady said that she can do it but that i would need to wait a moment until shes finished with the appointment I waited a half an hour and finally saw the lady I did not realize that she was pushing me in between her appointment and she did it very quickly maybe lasted about 20 minutes I have never had my nails done that only takes 20 minutes She ended up using a shellac gel instead of an actual gel builder And it was very clumpy and uneven to were you could see a dip in the middle of each of my nails The only reason Im giving it any stars is that the owner was very apologetic and tried to accommodate the situation but I was disappointed Also I had went there with a spa finder gift card I had 10 left instead of just taking the money off of that card and giving me the card to go somewhere else the receptionist traded it for a total bliss card This now forces me to have to go back to them just use the rest of the cardI have purchased my past two pairs of running shoes from this store and I have no complaints from either of those experiences  The employees appear to be very knowledgeable and will help you find the most suitable pair of shoes for your running style and price point  Although the shoe selection here isnt overwhelming there is a large enough variety to meet the needs of nearly every runner  Additionally I never felt as though I was being pushed into the most expensive pair of shoes that is reassuring because they carry some pretty expensive kicks  Another great aspect of this neighborhoodtype shop is that they offer running groups and training advice  So if youre thinking of entering some races or curious about ramping up your mileage the employees here are a great resource to tap intoOut of businessPerhaps the worst socalled Italian food I have ever eatenCant rate the food because I didnt have any but what an amazing bar The Christmas decorations are breathtaking the staff is very friendly and for being as beautiful and centrally located as it is alcohol prices were very reasonable Especially if you are travelingpassing through take an hour or so to stop by this bar You wont regret itOh Rhythm Room how I adore theeI have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed   Whenever The Rhythm Room Allstars play I definitely try to make it  They are rockin  I dig the dancing the bbq mmmmmm  and I enjoy when the fck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floorI do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open get in line get a table then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start  I always have a great time here  And now that you cant smoke its even betterThis rating is for service Was greeted promptly and quickly shown to a table where we waited  waited  waited No water No service Left an went somewhere elseVisited the Dave and Busters in Homestead PA last night Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs Charged them already too  both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was Waitress never apologized GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit  not even a refill After spending over 300 plus games we will never go back Whatever happened to the customer is always right HORRIBLE serviceI took a party of 6 friends and coworkers there last week when attending a tradeshow in Vegas  I will never do that againBiggest issue  The bill came and I noticed just about 30 added to the bill as tax  yes 30  When I asked the server about it he said that that includes 18 as service fee and 81 as tax  and that that is explained in the menu  I have several issues with this1 Shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print  my mistake but if you are reading this review you dont have to make this mistake2 Why am I forced to leave an 18 tip  The tip is not at my discretion  If the server is not helpful I cant express myself in any way  3 Why is listed as tax  I bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically  That is stealing4 Now it gets worse  I asked the server that if there is an 18 service fee plus an 81 tax that adds up to 261  So why is there an almost 30 charge  They add 81 to the bill and then they add 18 tip on top of it  So the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18Food  It was no special in any way  I am very familiar with Persian food  I have had it in many cities and many countries  I look for Persian restaurants everywhere I go  This restaurant is not bad but it is not good either  The food in NO WAY justifies the prices they charge  I had chicken with bones and it was not cooked well  For appetizer we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan and we had it with two kinds of stew  Tadig was good but not enough for 6 people  Stews were OK but again not specialService  It was OK  The server was not really pleasant smiling or welcoming  He was not rude or anything but I felt like we were bothering him being there  And the place was not busy  The service in NO WAY justified more than 18 in tip  But think about it the guy didnt care because he knew he will get his tip any way  I will not recommend this place  not for food not for service and not for being overchargedWent with some work friends on business Great timeIts nice to smell the fumes and rubber and to race with a real engine Ive raced at k1 speed and it doesnt beat the gas engines and the price of this place maybe 10 bucks cheaper per race on avg The jumpsuits and track size and config combined with the above make a great experience for adultsI also like their idea of membership if you wanna get competitive or come more often Didnt seem the same at k1 when I went back homeHighly recommendedI met with Doctor Mayy Deadrick a few weeks ago and immediately felt at ease I can tell that she will be a wonderful family doctor Best of all Mountain View is home to several doctors so we should always be able to get in the same day or the day after we get sick The waiting room felt clean and comfortable too which is a big plus for any doctors officeI have huge trust issues when it comes to my car At first I was really scared because I was getting 2k rims Advan TCIII and almost 3k worth of parts under the hood Juan exceeded my expectations They came out perfect With the amount of work time and effort he put into them Im surprised he didnt charge me more He gave me an awesome deal A few months later I brought a set of cheaper wheels used set of enkei rpf1 and a few suspension parts to get coated and the work was just as phenomenal Juan treated 800 worth of parts just as he would 5k worth of parts I wouldnt trust anyone else with powder coating my car parts I will always support quality work and that is why I will always be a customer of Juan and Snail MotorsportsYelp didnt exist when I used to go here back in the CMU days but it is still my favorite Soon Du Bu Tofu Stew place  we just LOVED it  We never ate sushi here always the korean food  The hae mul pah jun is yummy the dol sol bibimbap is good but the soon du bu jige is the best  Its run by Koreans hello  We were lucky to have this place in Pittsburgh  its not like there was a lot to choose from  But even now I rarely encounter a place in the Bay Area that has the same quality of tofu stew  and we have a ktown hereI should have left this review back in November when I stayed here with my parents  every time I look through our vacation photos I think about how much fun I had showing them Madison and how we enjoyed where we stayed just as much  Pat and Bob and Happy their dog were wonderful and their food was amazing  They make many of the ingredients on their property fresh maple syrup anyone  Would go back in a heartbeatI got my hair cut here about a month ago During the shampooing my scalp began to feel a little tingly but no biggie By the time I sat in the stylists chair though it felt as if my scalp was on fire My ears were bright red and anywhere else that the wet hair had touched my face turned the skin bright red Clearly I was having a bad reaction to their Avedaonly products  The stylist got very concerned and appropriately brought over the salon manager The clearly unconcerned hearditbefore manager said that she too had a bad reaction to their products as did some other customers and that I might want to take a Benadryl when I got home  End of story Not how can we make it better for you Not Oh I am so sorry this happened Take a Benedryl That and they charged me full price for my miserable experience  maybe they felt that they had to recoup the cost of rinsing my head againAny service professional that doesnt understand the importance of customer service will not get my money againI used to love Sir Eds however my recent visit was bad enough to make it my last The waitress alone was an example on how you dont treat your patrons She was irritable and snippy until the check came Suddenly when it was tip time she was courteous I wish Id left her less and overall Im a strict 20 tipper The food was not good either My fries tasted like fish The wrap was awful And it took forever The only good thing was the beer but you can get that at better restaurantsI would give this 0 star if I can We went in Sunday to start our day with some dim sums since they are the freshest on Sunday And they actually roll the dim sum in cartsWhen we walked in I can see they are very busy And theres 3 pplz in front of us The front lady asked us how many after I told her 2 she just walk off seating a guy in front of us She came back and start seating these 2 pplz came after us And then another lady came to ask how many we have While I was telling her 2 pplz the previous walked back and seat these 4 pplz just walk inSo I asked her is there supposed to be a line She was like no they seat according to table I was like I understand if the table fit 10 then u dont want to use it for 2 pplz However if the table fit 4 I expected to be seat before other pplz that just walk inThe dim sum is not the best but itll do for Charlotte Its just that lady just ruined my whole mood to eat there so we walk out and decided to try Krazy Fish down the roadProbably will not go back for a long whilePrepare for your mind to be blown This is one of Charlottes best secretsIt is on N Davidson in an industrialsketch area You walk into this STUNNING garden with plenty of art It is a delight You feel like you are transformed into a new place I cannot recommend this place enough It feels magical There are little paths that you can walk to with privacy There is a large area to be in with a big group We went for a rehearsal dinner and it was breath taking I highly recommend going hereFantastic brew selection Everyone here is willing to help One of our favorite spotsThe Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was originally a movie theater called The Stanley It was built in 1927 and was billed as Pittsburghs Palace of Amusement Its acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built 65 cents would not only buy you a photoplay but youd also get live entertainment too A two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the US Department of the Interior brought it back to its original condition The grand lobbys mirrors and woodwork are all original Of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater only one is a replica In fact the main chandelier weighs 4700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide The sightlines here are awesome It truly is a masterpiece of theater design Lets face it fellow Yelpers youre not here for my architectural reviews are you Okay I came here last night for the Decemberists concert featuring Justin Townes Earle as the opener There were only single seats left when I tried to get tickets So I ended up going by myself to the show Hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion The Portland OR based Decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their CD The King Is Dead has been doing quite well So much so that it reached 1 on the Billboard Charts in late January The Decemberists in the past have dabbled in socalled progressive rock and British folk but this new CD is definitely more of an AmericanaAlt Country sound So much so that the single Down by the Water reminds me of Firetowns The Good Life for some reason Firetown later evolved into Garbagein both senses of the word But thats another story So it was no surprise that after doing The Crane Wife Parts 13 Colin Meloy told the audience I dont know who wrote the set list but they thought we were a prog band Were not a prog band anymore Were a folk band Hmmm That actually was a pretty apt description Despite this they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue There was plenty of good singin and good playin though Sam Watkins of Nickel Creek played fiddle against Jenny Conlees accordion and they did a rousing Irish jig to the song Rox in the Box It was almost strange though how Meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song Rise to Me They also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show and face it folks you cant keep a good prog band down But anyway this show proved that the Decemberists arent some flash in the pan Their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that theyre in it for the long haul I should also mention that my 60something father a music fan in his own right absolutely loves the Decemberists Now you know where I get those genes from As I mentioned Justin Townes Earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar it should His father is the iconic Steve Earle another one of my favorites Justin gets his middle name Townes from Townes Van Zandt of whom Steve Earle was a great friend Justin Townes Earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his fatherI usually prefer body wraps to massages but Melanie made me forget wraps even exist She gave me such a wonderful hot stone massage and was extremely considerate of my preferences throughout  staying warm making the experience relaxing while still relieving tension and creating a calm peaceful environment She wasnt the least bit pushy and I left feeling more relaxed than I have in years All around its everything I want in a day at the spa and I cant wait to go backThis place is a jokeId rather be at Tao or PureThe maloofs really know what class is Britneys classyhahano thanksthats allWe were in Pittsburgh for one night and Olive or Twist was near our hotel  There were many other restaurants but this place looked nice  The atmosphere was nice and if I was rating only for atmosphere Id give it 4 stars  However Im mainly rating their food and service  We were greeted promptly but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinksfood even though there werent many people in the dining room  I ordered the Traditional French Dip Sandwich and Fries  I enjoy a good French Dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst Ive ever eaten In fact I couldnt finish it  The meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap glorified hot dog roll that was soggy  It wasnt soggy from the Au Jus but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason  Overall if I was going back to Pittsburgh in this area I would stay far away from Olive or TwistI used to go here up until I was seven years old Then my family moved to BostonFirst the wave pool is completely amazing to a little kid growing up in Arizona a kid who may have never seen waves before And the waterslide was scary as hell but awesome when I got up the nerve to go down itAnd then there are the ducks around the manmade Arizona pond I loved all those ducks and one time this duck let me put him on his lap and I pet him and he just stayed there I looked for that awesome duck each time I went back to the park afterwards but never found him againVery nice and quiet temple  Priests are very good and accommodating If you have pooja at home this is the best place to bring the priest from You dont have to pick and drop them they will drive and come Only disadvantage is that its too far from PhoenixI went in for a simple everyday ordinary haircut TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE thats 27300 later I came home with products I just HADTOHAVE pushed on me like drug dealers by everyone from the stylist the shampoo girl the facial girl the counter girls who just wouldnt take NO for an answer and are very welltrained to put you on the spot in front of other customers so as to embarrass you and trick you into buying something you really dont need just to boost their commission sales Jennifer hasnt the foggiest notion how to properly complete a mans haircut She neglected to trim the sideburns ear nose eyebrow and neck hair even though I asked her to which she responded We have people who do that for an extra charge and suggested I spend more money to have another girl wax these areas WTF Are you kidding me here REALLY On the lighter note I am getting a socalled complimentary facial Definitely a place where you should prepare yourself to be accosted by staff to spend more moneyBeyond disappointingWannabe HeavenOverpriced  Bunch of kids running the place I wonder what it will be called next year after this one failsFinally a hot pot restaurant that fill me up without emptying my wallet Great environment for small group of people to try out their hot pot Was told this is the place for great hot pot and bbq Was very happy about the experience with this restaurants The owner couple are very young energized and friendly Although the background music is a little loud but I was focusing on the food too much Dont go there after 700pm to midnight over weekend unless you want to hang out with young Chinese crowd They did offer different sauce for the hot pot but you have to ask for it My favorite is the the seafood hot potHave been going to MCV Salon for more than a year Always excellent service Corina is friendly and energetic  I always get a fantastic haircut  Very well put together shopHusband ordered calamari  tasted like the oil was very old   Watched waiter bring our food to table next to us and then take it back to kitchenthen they brought us both salads with OLD BROWN lettuce    Seriously that was a first for me  I have never been served spoiled lettuce at a restaurant     Hubby had salmon and said the flavor was good   I had stuffed pork loin special which was good with the exception of the side of pasta with pink disgusting sauce on it   What a disappointmentEach time Ive eaten here Ive been pleased with the food  The Beef Rendang is wonderfulthe lemon grass flavor is prominent and the pepper is just rightnot overpowering  Youll want to start off with the Roti Canai appetizer which is greatjust dont dribble the curry sauce on your tie cause it aint coming out  The peanut butter pancake dessert thingie is fun too  The Mango Chicken is aromatic and tasty but I prefer their Rendang to anything else  I think they do a fine job with the sushi and rolls as well  Im looking forward to trying other items here  If youre not sure about this place try it  I think youll like itYou cant go wrong with Cains The staff is friendly and the food is great Im a regular guest and Ive never been disappointed I highly recommend itOpen 24 hours gambling and topless entertainers12 hours of happy hourmachines hit constantly great service all around from the moment you walk in the door cheers Las Vegas atmosphereLoved their Squash with cheese pupusas Honesty when it come down to authentic salvadorian food you must try them here Beside they are huge and I easily get stuffed with 2 Try them and to drink make sure to try their kolachampan salvadorian soda I so recommend for you guys to try them outAfter discovering Lunchbox by my work i have become a weekly visitor it seems I havent been into vinyl long but this is the best shop in Charlotte mainly because of the awesome New selection Sure Manifest has a massive used section which is great but their new stuff is nothing compared to tiny Lunchbox Also a great place to learn about new music tooSouthwest Egg rolls and Fish tacos Mmmmmmmmm Ohh and the AMAZING Brews45 5 off for hard ass tiresThis is awesome  ive never been gokarting unless you count MarioKartLet me tell you this is NOTHING like MarioKart These things go somewhere around 60MPH and my best time around a 14 mile track was 127 Yes minute and 27 seconds whoosliding out is easy to do with their hard tires but seriously  this requires relinquishing all fears and pushing your driving skills to the extreme There is seriously very little riskIf youre a speed junkie like me you HAVE to do this BTW with a group its 70 bucks you get use of the lounge and their wii a tshirt free drink and 2 times around Plus you get to race your friends We were there for a bachelor party and had 13 peopleMy family and I love everything the JCC has to offer I use the gym pool and basketball courts quite often and they are always clean and very well maintainedWhile there were no insect carcasses in my food I was still not very impressed with my meal at PF Changs  I went for a business lunch with my boss  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eatingI think this meal was a firstI got steamed veggies and brown rice  Now I expected it to be pretty bland since it mentioned no sauces added at all  But the vegetables were rubbery not crisp like they should be after a good steaming The rice was pretty underdone as well so allinall they got nothing right  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit but it was too little too latePerhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick but this needed much more help than a little pepper  It was very bland and didnt taste like anything  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating  And of course there was no salt and pepper on the table so I couldnt even enjoy it the way I like Because I didnt pay I didnt complain to the waiter but normally this would not have passed by me  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable I still would not return here if given the choiceGreat selection of meat and sausage I dropped in on a lark and they had unlimited Skirt Steak which I couldnt find anywhere else in Madison totally weird coming from chicago  Great quality skirt required a bit of additional trimming but thats normalwill visit Jim again and againThis little farmers market is pretty solid Fresh local produce that beats the hell out of anything you can get at the grocery store The tomatoes they sell actually taste like tomatoes Their fruit is much better as well and the the kickerwait for itFreshly roasted Hatch green chilies They also have a peach orchard out back You can pick your own or buy them in the shop when theyre in season Just a great all around local farmers market You need to check it outAlthough the crepe was very good and our waiter was a kind young lady our seemingly great experience turned into a bitter one when a rude Monsieur told me to walk out or throw away a partial sandwich I had in my bag that I was going to finish from my breakfast earlier I understand if you would like to point out that it might not be allowed in this establishment considering I was completely unaware of it but if our table is still consuming from the restaurant as well I personally would consider it twice before interrupting what seemed to be a lovely afternoon snack with such an unwelcoming display of service Would not recommend this locationAn amazing date night experience The food was high quality and fresh Everything was delicious We ordered the ying yang potchoice of 2 broths with the Ma longspellling spicy and the coconut curry Both were fantastic but the spicy one is pretty spicy Our proteins were shabu beef New York beef pork belly and shrimp We also got some veggies and noodles Chef and owner was a really cool guy and stopped of at our table a few times throughout the night You can tell how passionate he is about the ingredients he uses This would be a great place for the whole family imo You can teach your kids about the foods and they can watch them cook We are already planning our next tripMy favorite breakfast place  Have good sandwiches also  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grillget the small portion unless you are a real MAN  Mixed grill has sausage could it be Riccis eggs onions and home fries soooo goooooooood  Use Mancinis bread for toast got the raisin toast  Yum  Have had many other items and just love the food  If you like to watch a true cook sit at the counter  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is funLunch is good sausage sandwich hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grillGets busy for Bfast so you may have to waitRemember it is a diner  Dont expect fancy decorGreat spot for a quick lunch if youre downtown  They offer mainly sandwiches  chips  soups Chilli salads cookies and coffeeteasoda For lunch they pack it to go in a lunch sack If you park in the parking garage of the building they are in they will validate for 2 hoursIf were being completely honest in our choice of terms there are few worldclass destinations in any given city The Biodome is one such place in Montreal Where else can you walk through 4 ecosystems in 12 hours and really get a feel for each ones particularitiesWhere else can you learn something on every visit whether youre 2 16 35 or 60 years old Where else takes an already awesome concept and execution and creates special theme events to make the experience even more amazing Yeah Im talking about the night visits where you get to see things in a completely different light  if youll forgive the pun The Biodome is one of Montreals must sees If youre visiting just go If youre lucky enough to live here and sometimes I need a reminder about that go and take in the experience and then start thinking of your return trip I am constantly amazed and proud of this world class Montreal siteThis a friendly neighborhood bar offering great happy hours and live entertainment several nights of the week plus an excellent Sunday brunch  Be sure to check out the Freaky Fridays shows featuring Celia Putty each Friday nightI rarely write reviews but this is my favorite place in glendale especially if you like live piano playing I am a pianist my self and these guys are so talented I could never in a million year do what they do and I have played classic piano for about 12 yearsI grew up in Glendale and know of only a few places to go on certain nights  However this place is great  I assure you the musicians are great if you have a musical ear and a sense of humor  They can pretty much play anything you request Finally they have pretty good drink specials and have very nice bartenders  a sense of humorUpdateUpgrade to 5 stars  cannot find a better boba or bubble tea as I used to call it   And to include in my update  Lobster Balls  What are these fried balls ogoodness exactly  I dont care  Went for medium spicy and I like spicy  dont want to try the really spicy as am afraid I wouldnt get any of the lobster taste  Great combo with the boba if you want a little bite to eatGreat place if you need youre boba tea fix Always hits the spotCASH ONLY  What a pleasant surprise  I went here for the first time last night and wasnt sure what to expect when i walked in  The place seems to have some spacial issues  There was a bar but they dont serve alcohol more of a coffeediner bar  The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable but maybe this is by design  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf  Anyhoo to the food  This place is vegetarian only   I started with a Hummus plate unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers carrots celery calamata olives big fan and pita Perfect starter  For my main entree i ordered the curry special  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint   Everything was in the bowl chick peas basmanti rice carrots and other miscellaneous items  Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not stop  It was savory spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night    This is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to timeHad such a great time here Plazma has a dive bar feel as least when I went Cocktails were cheap and strong The bartender was so nice and friendly and worked his butt off all night  he did a great jobI like the little outdoor seating area and theres a good amount of parking Overall very chill very niceI agree with Veronika O Dr Tengs office managersister is the nasiest rudest and most arrogant  person Ive dealt with in the medical field Its amazing he still has a practice with the way his office is run Even the staff at Mountainview Hospital dont want to deal with her When I had surgery there and they needed a form from his office they asked me to call because they didnt want to deal with her i also told my family Dr never to refer him again There are other surgeons find someone elseI love this place I have white blond eyebrows and eyelashes and finding a salon that can dye them the correct colors without making a mess of things is difficult at best  When I explained exactly what I needed the girl who did my tinting sadly I cant remember her name but she was super awesome and nice got it exactly right I will be back here every 6 weeksedit the person I saw was LauraI am in the market for an entrylevel shotgun for skeet and field birds  Heard about this place and thought I would give it a try after work yesterday  I arrived 10 minutes before closing 550pm and was greeted enthusiastically when I walked in  I told the greeter that I was new to the store and to firearms in general  After a quick discussion  about what I was looking for he immediately introduced me to an extraordinarily knowledgeable associate  By the way at 550pm on a monday this place was PACKED  But there seemed to be 30 or more associates working so there was no waiting  Since I was new to skeet shooting my person helped me look at different fits and helped me with some shouldering and sighting techniques  The prices seem inline with what you would find anywhere else  I was not ready to buy that day but I am confident I will buy there when the time is rightI would rather drive out of my way to another Home Depot than give this location my business Employees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice youre standing there in front of them Strike that Im certain they notice they just dont careIm a pretty understanding person but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit its time to go There are plenty of HDs around seek them out and skip this one especially if youre going to have questionsJim is the best masseur I have ever seen Hes very knowledgeable in his massage techniques and in muscle release I had a lower back problem for several years and his sessions helped reduce my pain and eventually make it go away completely He excels at finding the tense places in the neck shoulders and hips and releasing them Hes a great sports massage therapist and knows deep tissue trigger point and cranial sacral techniques The combined styles he uses works better than any one massage technique Ive tried in the past  Hes very flexible with scheduling and works late nights so when I cant make it in the evening I can usually get my massage at night Though he does out calls I always went to him because he has a spa next to the massage room that I can relax in and warm up before he works on me which makes the massage much more effective and gives quicker resultsI just visited this super fun frozen yogurt shop today and I am totally in LOVE  It is selfserve frozen yogurt that you add your own toppings to  They have a bunch of flavors to pick from so you can mix and match  They also have loads of fresh fruit chocolate sprinkles and even mochi  red bean paste to put on your delish frozen yogurt  After you pick out everything you want they weigh it and charge you per ounce  It is a really fun place to go and it tasted greatI had pineapple mango and strawberry froyo topped with fresh pineapple mango coconut mochi and kiwi  A word to describe  ScrumdiddlyumptiousMore of a mans garden     When I lived in Phoenix a couple years ago the Papago Park Desert Botanical Gardens was one of my favorite places to take outoftown visiting friends and relatives You tell them HEY LETS GO TO THE BOTANICAL GARDENS  They grumble a little especially the men They of course expect rose gardens tulip beds lavendar and Queen Annes Lace  WRONG  It is a fifty acre garden of beautiful cacti and succulents     beautiful desert plants But no whoosy northern plants needing moisture here These are desert survivors Desert rats Desert birds Desert songs Desert lifeA mans garden of delights    tough masculine desert plants here but with delicate beautiful flowersGardening help botanical research  education workshops event facilities taste of the desert tours Monarch Butterfly exhibit garden tours special music art and romantic evening events childrens events So much to do  see so little time      even a man will love it hereThere is ALWAYS something going on at the PAPAGO PARK DESERT BOTANICAL GARDENS  I cant make up my mind whether to go down for the SAHNAS BROTHERS SPANISH GUITAR event in February or wait for the AGAVE ON THE ROCKS in March Hmmm     which one which one which one Cant do both     Check it out  wwwdbgorg  TELL ME WHAT TO DO  Friends are expecting me      it is cooler in Phoenix in February than it is in March     maybe I should let the weather dictateNo matter the temperature this is not a place to miss A delight of the possibilities of our world Every size shape and kind of cacti  succulent from around the world is here Check it outwwwdbgorgI cant believe this place only has one review  But I can believe that the one review is a 5 star rating  I also believe that Tom Fridays defines the term Meat shop  Ive never been disappointed  Excellent meats good quality at reasonable prices and great customer service  Ive had several of their offerings including the premade hoagies yummy and homemade kielbasa perfectly seasoned  Their ground meat makes the most delectible burgers  The huge cuts of steak Ive had were always the freshest  And Im always a fan of the popular butter steaks  Basically my review is this if you like good meat support your local meat shop and stop by Tom Fridays Market  Youll be glad you treated yourselfA great intimate setting to see some local theatre I went to a performance of Plaid Tidings and really enjoyed the show You sit at tables rather than the usual sidebyside audience seating and can order drinks and food beforeduring the showThey have a small bar which seemed to get quite overwhelmed during intermission We had to wait a while to get a drink but there were a lot of people there all at once so that is bound to happenThe ushers and other staff were all very polite I was also impressed by some of their past shows they had displayed on the wall and would definitely go back for another showWe found tons of great vinyl records here Excellent prices The dollar bins held all of the treasuresI walked in and I was taken back into time I am a mature seasoned citizen The Avenue reminded me of numerous restaturant  bars in Chicago Not too bright not too dim Crowded and lots of lively conversation coming from the bar and restaurant I came here for the FISH FRY I heard it was top notch They were right Started off with an excellent New England clam chowder There were substantial pieces of clams in the soup Surprise surprise Very well seasoned I did not even consider adding salt or pepper I am sensitive to salt and it was not overdone Next came the Fried Cod It wasnt a Long John Silvers fry It was more like a tempura batter A light coating over two large fillets I chose fries to accompany the plate For a Friday night at 700pm only had to wait 15 minutes Very courteous and accommodating staff Well I will be back to try other items on the menu But then again maybe not I have been to the top of the mountain I like fish too Give them a tryJohnny Chitownno stars place is disgusting found a wormcatapillar in the kim chi didnt give us a refund gross dont go there for any of the food its so dirty so dirty so rude so cheap signs everywhere about extra chargesIve always loved this bar and have gone since it opened  Love Paul the best bartender in the world Once he waits on you you pretty much never have to tell him your order again Great apps  But I must admit I havent gone lately due to having to pay to park after 5pm  Think its ridiculous  Great people watching The first time I stepped into the store I was hit by a wave of wonderful aromas that reminded me of growing up in Germany The lunch meats smoked hams brats blutwurst etc are from authentic German recipes and one can even get a real schnitzel here The ladies behind the counter treat you like you would get treated in a store in Germany and the store also offers a selection of foods imported from Germany Jams coffee breads dairy products like butter and quark cookies candy canned goods cooking and baking mixes If you have German recipes and havent made them because you cant find the right ingredients or if you just like good food please pay this store a visit You will be pleasantly surprised But bring cash No credit cards accepted Or you could go next door to the Black Forest Mill to have your German meal prepared for you along with a German beerPowder coating plus is one of the best vendors we have  They get our product in right away and we never have any issues Everything always comes out looking amazing Their quality control is impeccable  They are great to work with We wouldnt take our stuff anywhere else We only take it to the best and they are definitely the best Thank you guys for all your hard work We love you at All Metal maintenance standsI got to do the ordering tonight and it was a fabulous meal at CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe I have never seen a restaurant that is so eclectic you have traditional noodle dishes both hot and cold from Japan along with Sushi pasta dishes from Italy and some items from SouthEast Asia There is more than enough diversity in their menu to satisfy the most discriminating palate Despite their diversity CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe does not stray from the basic tenant of Japanese Cuisine food items are never too salty or too sweet and are never bland you can call it cooking subtletyFor starters I ordered a California Summer Roll Vietnamese for my friend and myself Unlike the Vietnamese Summer Roll spiced with mint and usually accompanied by a lime dipping sauce CherryBlossoms version was accompanied by a sauce comprised of sweet Sesame Seed  Soy Sauce dip A Summer Roll contents include Shrimp Rice Vermicelli Crab strips and Cabbage wrapped with a thin Rice Paper tortilla Anyone used to the Vietnamese version will see CherryBlossoms as probably a little bland but you have to remember the philosophy behind Japanese cookingMy friend also had Miso Soup with his meal Unlike the soup yesterday evening he said the Miso Soup was very goodWith every meal you will also receive a bread basket  httpcherryblossomazcomcherrybreadgif  The basket contains three types of breads a soft and warm French Roll a slice from a dark and sweet Blueberry bread and a crispy Butter Biscuit There is enough variety in texture from all the breads to satisfy anyoneMain dishesI ordered for my friend Grilled Orange Roughy The Orange Roughy was grilled to perfection and was accompanied by a sweet and salty dipping sauce concoction Sides consisted of Japanese sticky riceI ordered for myself the Beef Nanban Soup with thin Soba Wheat Noodles rather than the Udon Noodles accompanied by a bowl of Japanese Sticky Rice My friend does not drink but I ordered the Rasperry Fruit Punch a very good drink made from Raspberry Wine with Fruit Punch essentially a Raspberry Wine Cooler but stronger This drink also had an umbrella thing spearing a whole strawberry Very good and refreshingI had my usual coffee after the meal which surprised me a little an Amaretto laced coffee was brought out The aroma was very enticing Would make a coffee drinker out of anyone100 of capacity with 30 Asian 20 Hispanic rest Caucasian First time Ive been to a restaurant that was packed with NO seats left A very popular spotCherryBlossom is very heartily recommended so long as you remember the tenets of Japanese Cuisine no extreme flavors nothing will be extremely spicy salty or sweet This makes it easy to grab a little from this dish and something from that dish without disrupting the flavor of eitherThere was something that was a little disconcerting though The state of the mens room For such a highly rated establishment it seemed like no one had checked on the mens room for about two to three hours toilet paper thrown around stains around the wash basin Nothing really objectionable but a little surprising considering the number of staff for such a small establishment This establishment has to be aware that a restaurant is judged by its backroom as well as its front room Wont take anything off but it is highly noticeable consideringAnd the diners of CherryBlossom has to share the same restrooms with Tokyo Express right next door both of the businesses are probably owned by the same management group The interesting tidbit is that we both spent MORE for a worse meal last night at Bamboo House AMAZING My friend said his dishes from the Summer Roll to the Grilled Fish was some of the freshest tasting dishes he ever had good compliment from him In fact he wanted to go back to CherryBlossom the next evening but this is my last night here in the Phoenix area sighI really think everyone is reviewing CherryBlossom under the wrong spelling Its CherryBlossom not Cherry Blossom Take a look at their sign or their websiteThis music store should be THE example for all music stores The staff are knowledgable friendly and professional Ive had a few guitars set up to perfection that were supposedly set up previously HIGHLY recommendVery fun The acceleration is great Great to go with bunch of friends The only caveat is that its a bit pricey and the race is a bit too shortBut you must go there Seriously its a great racing experiencePerfect time with hubby after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal waitress was such an adorable girl Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great jobStrawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was  Strawberry milkshake nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop orderingIts always nice when u go late at night like us it is not crowded not noisy nice music playing and always nice people around If you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say DennysQuite a number of the best meals in my life came courtesy of the fantastic chef and extremely cordial waitstaff at Blue Whether for birthdays work meetings or just a desire for a nice night out Blue never disappointed and they often outperformed even themselves on many occasionsThe staff here is without a doubt one of the best trained in the city from the waiters to the hostess to the managers and owners everyone treats you with a high level of respect and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the restaurant when youre there After a few visits I found one waiter I liked even more than the others and I would always request his table when I came with no problem from the scheduler Dont forget if you bring your own wine which I do quite frequently make sure to pour some for your waiter Not that you NEED to bring wine to Blue because they have a wine list that is second to none well maybe Bonterra in CharlotteIts hard to recommend specific dishes at Blue because Ive had so many fantastic ones and they change very frequently with the seasons Its a Mediterranean style of cuisine so expect heavily herbed flavors on whatever you get and an emphasis on great sauces Perhaps my favorite meal here was a whole shank of Osso Bucco served over fava beans and mashed sweet potatoes with a crab and lobster risotto on the side Pure decadence If you see this dish on the menu it is the one thing I would suggest getting over anything else as the meat is so falloffthebone delicious it is nearly impossible to surpass The duo of bison cuts is another one I would highly recommendThe cheese selection at Blue is also topnotch There are usually 1520 to choose from including several expensive bleu cheeses which are fortunately all the same price here It comes with honeycomb and pecans on the side and unlike many other restaurants doesnt cost extra Another one of my favorite elements about this restaurant is the very first thing you get when you sit down hearty bread and the most wonderful spread Ive ever tasted Its a kalamata olive based butter that looks a bit funky at first but once you eat your first piece the bowl gets quickly emptiedBe sure to save plenty of room for desert as well Blues dinner portions can be quite dramatically large because they whip up some of the fanciest creations you can find in the Charlotte area And for those of you that dont go for overly sweet temptations there is also a huge fresh berry desert with homemade ice cream one of my favoritesHey guys and gals   As you know I am a volunteer usher at the Benedum Last night SEINFELD       Tonight CELTIC THUNDER   I highly recommend buying a season certificate or a package deal to the Benedum Next year is GREAT Wickedis the the featured attraction    What a GREAT Christmas or birthday gift Right      Do check into it and BUYI like to climb things Ive learned  This place is a tad bit far me but totally worth the drive  Looks fun  is fun looks hard  is hard  I know youre not supposed to use your arms much while climbing but damn when youre up that high you cant help but be a little afraid of falling  Thus clinching for dear life  Needless to say my arms are sore  This would be a great family gathering but also if youre looking for a good workout with a twist  its a must  Thumbs way upHavent been in a while not really a bike nut or even a regular rider but I have to relate a story to tell you what kind of a place this is I inherited a bike my dad had purchased in college and hard a part break I knew that Kraynicks would be the only place able to help even though at the time there were still Schwinn authorized dealers in the area Heres the exchange Me I have an old Schwinn threespeed probably from 1969 or 70 and it has this little washer with a raised part that fits in the groove between the fork and the rear axle That part broke Him A Collegiate or a Speedster Me amazed Speedster At which point he turned around to a wall of tiny drawers that seemed to stretch from floor to ceiling and appeared to have no intelligible labeling pull open a single drawer and produce the part I needed It cost something like 30 cents Places like this pretty much do not exist anymore the shop is like a museum of bicycle parts and the upper stories of the building are reportedly just as full If the recurring rumors of its closing  Mr Kraynicks retirement are any indication it may not be here forever FIND ANY EXCUSE to get here while its still aroundFrom Downtown Chicago so used to great hair care But this place reminded me of home Linda is phenomenal and after stepping a few feet from the door I got a compliment on my hair I highly recommend this to anybody whos looking for great and relaxing haircutA must do on Thursday evening if youre a tourist Tons of art galleries feature lots of Native American culture sculptures jewelry and some of the galleries have wine Expensive but a great way to appreciate art If youre staying at a local hotel find a golf cart driver They work off tipsIve only been there a few times but it was a nice place  good staff they mix drinks well and its a friendly atmosphereSaw Phantom when it came through Grew up seeing Nutcracker every year JC Superstar was awesome Beautiful place and Pittsburgh is soooo lucky to have itI honestly believe i can serve people instant noodles off the street that taste a lot better then the garbage they serve here wouldnt be surprised to know that the food they serve ARE instant noodles but horribly fucked up by a chef that was born with no taste budsAnd for a place within such amega rich high class casino would it hurt you to serve filtered water instead of crap you get from the dish washeri mean honestly its only a few bucks extra but its little things like that gives you them extra pointsI havent been here yet but after reading about the Bikes Before Christmas project here httpwwwpostgazettecompg0831192559594stm I just want to go here and buy some bike stuffMore about Bikes Before Christmas here  httpiheartpghcom20081106donatebikesforkidsNothings puts me in the holiday spirit more that a visit to Phipps Winter Flower Show I love all the cute animal displays and the poinsettias hanging baskets and the Xmas trees are beautiful and fragrant I love how they manage to fill the Serpentine Room with such nice holiday displays My favorite room is always the Orchid Room There are so many different varieties and I love to be able to see them up close and marvel at their beauty I also love the Tropical Forest Conservatory Its so peaceful and tranquil I love the Sunken Garden and The Victoria Room too Also the Broderie Room was also very beautiful in its holiday decor I cant wait to visit again in the SpringI have been to this place plenty of times I have always had good meals and service But tonight was bad I went ther with my wifes work friends We sat at the bar tables and had a bartender named Bovery red hair   We had About 8 people and he insisted that if we sit at the tables we have to order food which we had planned to do He seemed annoyed with us because we just ordered fried oysters and lots of drinksit was Friday and happy hour so we were sitting around chatting and drinking  we were actually going to order an entre and stay for dinner but Bo seemed very disinterested in us until it came time to pay the bill then he was really nicetip time Overall the food is good there but Bo did not make it a pleasant experience Smile Bo it will get you far in lifeWe went for the indoor pool since Heritage Complex is a bit too far The front dest was rude the girl who checked us in at the pool was not friendly and the pool area was pretty dark and it was small We will Not be going there againBest German sausages that I ever had  They taste the same as those that I had when I traveled to Germany  And the best thing is that they will vacuum packed them so they can last for a month and taste just as fresh as long as you dont break the packageHurray Little Tokyo  I havent been here in years but this is THE place that I got introduced to sushi  I still remember hesitantly slurping down my first salmon roll thinking raw fish must be the most awful thing in the world and well kinda loving it  The owners are good friends of my family from back when we lived in Pittsburgh  I remember when they were first starting outmy dad helped design and build the sushi counter and my mom made the original cushions and server uniforms  One time I had an epic wasabieating contest with the owners son  On many a weekend as a kid I would go and stuff my face with all the sushi I could eat  I know for a fact they use the freshest fish I may be biased but I think my early experiences with massivesushioverload helped refine my tastebuds and make me the sushi snob I am today  Oh yeah and they have FRIED ICE CREAMOooooounder new management Humidors are fully stocked drinks are delicious and there is regular music The new owners are wonderfully gracious hosts and each time I go I meet a new friend Best newold Fitchburg hangoutI started making mead a couple of years ago and the staff here was very helpful and answered questions My favorite thing about this place is that it is one of the only brew stores that hasnt treated me like I were a lost child I just love this placePittsburgh has a Four SeasonsFrom Paris to Shanghai London to Bangkok the care with which this little BB operation is run in Pittsburgh exceeds the best that I have experienced in any of these citiesIt may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel the business center or inhouse spa but as a BB this is about as good as it gets The structure in which the whole thing is held do we call it a house is old perhaps we could say it generically to be victorian with decor to match These are far from our tastes but they compensate in our eyes by taking good care of what they have The TVs arent even old flat screens but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with loccitaneWhere this place really shines is in the staff and the food I actually find this aspect to be better or even much better than many celebrated bigcity fivestar properties When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator gratis after a midnight arrival caused by flight delaysThey make everything inhouse and it is all extraordinary On this last visit I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit not just big grocery store chucks of melon and housemade cookies and muffins On each visit they mix these up For this December visit they did gingerbread cookies of course The Chef Jackie from NYC could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top bigcity restaurantThere is no elevator so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room The 1st floor room has double doors so I didnt find it any noisier than the others You are in a city and on a reasonably busy street so dont expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard although they do have an attractive new deck out backFirst Vegas Strip Club experience Little Darlings was an amazing experience lol Hottest chicks all nude best overall value compared to other Strip clubs in Vegas which are topless only and super expensive Went on a Tuesday and it was awesome plenty of girls good atmosphere They say the lap dances are two for one on Tuesday but it seems all the strippers had their own price some say 20 for a lap dance others 40 Either way great experience fine girls for sure Will go again next time Im in Vegas The only complaint is the cover which is 30 for visitors and if you get money out of the ATM there its a 10 fee which is insane so bring plenty of cashI agree with Jason B the service here SUCKS  You have to flag down the wait staff and tell them what you need they are NOT helpful  The food was good when I got it  I came here with a group of 14  Most of our party already had dessert while I still even hadnt gotten my salad  I was the last one sitting at the table when everyone got up still eating my food  This was not a pleasant experience  The waiter was EXTREMELY forgetful and had to be told several times that I didnt have my food  I feel that my meal should have been comped because the way things were handled I AM NEVER GOING BACKI really like SoHo  First off its located on the north shore and close to everything  Nice bar friendly staff sleek and modern  Great place to watch a game LCD screens everywhere  Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp  They do a really good job with a filet mignon  The salmon picata looked yummy but since it wasnt mine I didnt get to taste it  If you dont want a big meal they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers  For dessert have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake  Or if youre not feeling fancy just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger  Its that kind of place tooI love Shabu Shabu and have been going to the Shabu Shabu in Henderson I wont name to be fair for a long time We decided to try this place Swish to get something a little different In the end we were extremely disappointed and wish we could recommend it but just can not Decor and ambiance are OK Waitress was nice Peach tea was good Prices fairThe major problem was the food We ordered chicken and beef with shabu shabu and sukiyaki Firstly the sukiyaki and dipping sauces were way too salty and just not appealingly flavored Secondly the chicken was in chunks not sliced and had all sorts of cartilage and chewy bits The chunks wouldnt cook because they were too thick The chicken was completely inappropriate and also tasted bad because it was served marinated in some sort of sauce that neither of us liked I just couldnt eat the chicken at all My companion ate it just so we wouldnt waste it but he didnt like it either The beef was ok and sliced appropriately and I ate that in the shabu shabu but without a good dipping sauce was ultimately just disappointing I like cabbage but they served way too much of it and not nearly enough of the other vegetables or tofu or noodlesThe minor problem was the hot pots They were extremely shallow and the waitress didnt pay attention to them so they were constantly boiling down and at multiple points were down to almost nothing so we couldnt cook our foodI left hungry and sadThese very well might be the best donuts in the Phoenix area  Great price helpful and happy service  Great variety even though I arrived at 430 PM and all items were light fluffy delicous fresh and not too sweet  Worth every biteI was just here for an absolutely stunning Chihuly exhibit Amazing Dont miss it Best part of our tripI have high standards too because Im familiar with Longwood Gardens near Philadelphia Looks like the place is a bit lacking in flowering plants if the exhibit wasnt there But still really neat and worth a visitI only wish I could find more of their products YUMMY A word to all SUPPORT YOUR SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES You will get fresher healthier food and keep more of each dollar you spend in your community Good job Crows Dairy I love your goat products Let me know if you make ice cream Ill be the first to go out and buy itWent on a date with my girlfriend and had a blastPole position has faster cars than the usual ones at family fun center places  The facility is clean and the staff is friendlyI really enjoyed the real time lap times on the jumbo tron so that I could monitor my racing but the thing that really got me excited was the post race analysis  As you leave the pit you are handed a score sheet that shows off your lap times and charts your progressA 15 lap race is about 25  We got the 2 races and a T Shirt combo for 45I would do this againIve been to several Dicks sporting good stores and this one is by far one of the worst A few years ago I took my mountain bike to them for a basic service Upon picking it up I realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor I brought this up to the staffs attention who didnt hesitate in saying that I was wrong and they dont do that I asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff I asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didnt want to do that either I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologizedI since stopped frequenting them Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently I had a backpack on as I rode there in my motorcycle I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues I told her that I had been in other dicks sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the storeI told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in itThis brand has high prices and the staff isnt very knowledgeable nor very pleasant They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels its patheticI wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the areaSo Ive been with carefree tan for about 2 years now and I love it I would seriously not go anywhere elseMe and my boyfriend are there everyday The staff is very friendly and efficient Some people would say that its a little pricey but I beg to differ me and my boyfrind have unlimited tanning with mistique included on a family plan which is definitly worth doingif an option and its great we love itThe beds are awesome very powerful and have built in fans The mistique is awesome I spray every time after I lay down and I get really dark even after the first timehighly recommendedOkay so my big beef here is not so much with this LOCATION of Bath and Body Works but rather with Bath and Body Works as a company in general Let me explain For starters I just want to say that this store is clean wellpresented and has some very nice girls working in it The scents of candles and lotions are incredible and they were hard to resist with their Fall displays front and center with names like Autumn Leaves and Cinnamon Pumpkin Their prices are reasonable and their gift items are very nice Sighso heres why Ill never shop here again I came in to check out the store and in my browsing around grabbed a tester for a particular scent and gave it a try I always like to do this with lotions and perfumes before I commit to purchasing I put it on and walk around with it for a few hours to let it soak in since it always smells different than when you first put it on So I left the store and for the next hour could not stop smelling my hands  it was so good it was intoxicating I dont even remember which scent it was but thats not important anyway An hour and a half later I was back in the store and heading for the counter bottle in hand So Im reading the back Im trying to be ever so conscious about my purchases especially beauty products in that I only buy products that are parabenfree and NOT tested on animals Call me uptight but I just dont think animals should be tortured so I can smell like fake juniper I scan the label and see that it does contain parabens but it smells so friggin good I make an exception Then I see it This finished product not tested on animals And for a minute I think Great Ready to buy And thenthisfinished product  What the heck does that mean Normally if a product is not tested on animals it will just say Not tested on animals or We NEVER test our products on animals or the like And if it says nothing you always assume that they do test on animals But This FINISHED product So the final product that fills the bottle in my hand the one that I intend to use has not been tested on any animal But what about everything before that And then I just got mad Very mad Do they think we are idiots Some big shot at BBW must believe that their customers are totally mindless lazy and can be easily fooled by the wording they chose I dont know what made me more mad the fact that they do test on animals or the fact that they take us all for idiots and try to play like they dont run the tests Either way out of principle I put the bottle back and decided I will never again give a dime of my money to BBW Excuse the rant but this just really pissed me offWhat a great place to visit This is the coolest reused building Ive ever been into it was the Velodome of the 76 Olympic Games The habitats were well put together and the animals seemed to have enough space to hide and be seen The rainforest is really really hot the bat exhibit was cool and scary and the penguins were delightful I loved how the birds could all fly and that it actually rained in parts of the dome It is an AZA accredited facility and the docentskeepers were all very helpful I will definitely be back on our next trip to MontrealSlow service I can handle took about 20 mintues to get two glasses of water and we were there over an hour and a half during a slow time to get two cheesesteaks  Average food expected just looking for something quick and close  The icing on the cake was when the waitress lost my credit card  Now I realize this could easily happen however she didnt bother to tell me that she lost it  Finally after her being gone 20 minutes with my card we found her and asked her what the delay was to which she responded did I by chance give you back your credit card  My first thought was TELL ME RIGHT AWAY SO I CAN CALL THE BANK  I told her that and her response was I know but I was so embarrassed  Luckily they found our card eventually but if someone else had found it they could do a lot of damage in 20 minutes with all the shops around thereAs a side note during our LONG HORRIBLE experience two other groups came in and left after about 20 minutes of not even having a waiterwaitress say boo to them  I wish we had seen their experiences before we orderedI wish 0 stars was an option I would have chosen itYou must go to Le Tigre  I just love it I do wish they had tap beer and a better selection in  bottles but everything else about it is fantastic  This is the most loungy lounge Ive seen inmaybe ever  I dont imagine theyve changed anything since the day they opened in like the sixties  including the music in the juke box  7 plays for 100This was my favorite joint in the CLT  I have never been to New Orleans and because of Katrina I probably  wont for awhile but I imagine that this is a pretty good joint even by looziana standards  I always get the blackened platter with chicken and the fish special with one of their rotating toppings usually  one with crawfish and corn and a side of gumbo  MMMMMMMMMMFor the money you really cant beat this deal  For half as much as I was paying for my gym membership in Chicago I get an allaccess membership to the YMCAs in Charlotte  The facilities are great the staff are all helpful and the Dowd Branch probably the best location is near my homeI have heard a lot about the locker breakins but have been lucky so far knock on woodNice work YMCAThe fish fry is awesome  Loved it long time  The red potatoes with cheese are delishIts carry out but that is fineTake it out pop in a movie and have a brandy old fashionThe latinos working their are hot tooThis is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant I have eaten at The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice which basically was white rice with chopped onions to the chicken which was so pale it looked like it was boiled Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char which none of our food had I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible Our waiter didnt even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces he acted confused when I asked for them Additionally we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesnt even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other Ive eaten atI came here for the first time and didnt know what to expect It turned out to be a lot of fun First we went on a Friday its 7 cash at the door to get in At 730 the dance lesson beganor was supposed to it started more around 745 The lesson of the night was West Coast swing Apparently they teach different genres of dance every week you need to check their website to see what they are offering for that week They split off the beginners from the intermediateadvance dancers Us beginners were put in a smaller dance room studio to my releif as I have never danced West Coast Swing and was nervous to be in front of advanced studentsAfter an hour of class which goes by very fast they have an open dance floor until midnight Most of the people there are people who simply love dance They switch up the music to a different genre for every song ie waltz foxtrot salsa rumba swingetc Even if you are not a great dancer or only know one genre of dance its certainly fun to watch everyone There are some really good pros and amateurs no one really cares what you look like out there everyone is just there to dance There were people there of many age groups as wellfrom early 20s to 60s or 70sI love that you can just drop in for a class No sign up or commitment necessary Im looking forward to dropping in again soonMichelle is a godsend went in for a simple fussless updo and was stunned by the result She is quite the perfectionist and for 25 her mastery is bizarrely affordable Forever bookmarked Note street parking can be fairly difficult to find on S Highland so scour the smaller adjacent streets for a free 2 hoursMy boyfriend surprised me with a hot air balloon ride for my 25th birthday last week Kevin and his partner were vibrant hosts and were both very knowledgeable about flying I thought I would be a little nervous but the ride was smooth and these guys are obviously pros which put me at ease Kevin knew the lay of the land well and served as an excellent tour guide The champagne toast at the end was a perfect treat at the end of our flight I would definitely recommend taking a trip with Kevin The other balloons we saw taking off around us were carrying 814 people each and our little basket held two couples and Kevin Im very glad my boyfriend booked with 2 Fly Us because we had a more intimate tripthe other couple on our flight was lovely Two notes Be prepared to wake up early and the flame for the balloon is HOT I regretted wearing a nice top because I definitely sweated through it Goes for any hot air balloon flight but thought it was worth mentioningSo Ive lived in Las Vegas for about 10 years now and have been to the Las Vegas Mini Gran Prix a bunch of times I enjoy taking my kids and out of town guests out to ride and play in the arcade Its a fun place on weekends with the buzz from all the activity I had some friends in town last weekend and they wanted to do something NONStrip related as they had been doing all of the shows and attractions I suggested the LVMGP and we had a blast My friends loved the place and we landed up spending about 4 hours there just goofing around and acting like kids They have an awesome automated Cotton Candy Machine that you have to tryI though we were going to be there for a an hour tops but we landed up being there until about dinner time We worked up a bit of an appetite and after looking at the menu thought wed give it a shot Listen Las Vegas Mini Gran Prix has an awesome menu If there is a category for The tastiest LEAST Greasy Pizza Ive ever had Id vote LVMGP tops Their 16 Large 1 topping pizza is killer and at only 499 with a text in dealits even more yummy They have baked chicken wings and BBQ ribs that are out of this world Tender Juicy Wow Honestly I never expected such great quality to

General Surgeon He lived up to His positive surgical reputation With any surgery there are risks and not everything is always perfect With that said I have had minimal side effects to this point 2 months laterFor the past 15 years or so I have been a satisfied and happy customer of KKL  I absolutely love everything about Knock Kneed  The fish is among the best that you will find in the Phoenix area  I am also a big fan of the okra  The ambiance here is also quite enjoyable  There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant and the nautical themed decorations make it one of a kindYou cant go wrong hereI am sorry to say that this place still STINKS  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim  I stopped in for lunch today and I was the only person in the whole place  That should have tipped me off  The last time i was there i had a bad meal but i wanted to give them another shot  I ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu  I believe is was L1Numbered menu itemsAnother tip   My food was terrible  The miso soup was horrid and old the sides were awful and everything seemed to be microwaved  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTSI hated this place  It might have just been a bad time but I doubt Ill ever go backI arrived and found a seat outside so as to smoke  I go in and get a PBR its loud theres a DJ Im happy to be outside  I got pestered by a waitress a few times while sitting outside but I cant really complain about that since she was kind and was trying to help us out  I had two beers and was ready to leave when I went to the bathroom  On my way there I got punched in the face accidentally by some chick that was dancingWhen I woke up the next morning I got a call from my bank about a 25 charge at Cowboy Monkey to my account  I checked the receipt in my pocket and sure enough it was a 5 bill  Turns out they take a 25 hold out on your card when you open a tab to make sure the card is good  The catch though is you dont get your money back for a few days  Im still out 20 to them three days later  I paid 25 for two bottles of PBR at this pointSo to sum it up I got punched in the face by an enthusiastic dancer and got WAY overcharged  So Im not too pleased with the placeAfter visiting the Brush Bar our standard on painting and wine drinking were set high The Art of Merlot lacks character enthusiasms and creativity With no guidance you are left on your own recreating a complicated painting For 45 you get a 3 canvas and a couple dollars worth of paint and youre expected to bring your own wine The staff was nice enough but lacked enthusiasm and guidance that the Brush Bar had Needless to say I would always choose the Brush Bar for a night of art and wineI now understand where the name comes from Yesterday I went into Dicks to buy my daughter some shirts As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package It said things like  missing manual or dead battery I found a watch that was missing a manual I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for I purchased the watch as is and took it home After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones I got annoyed I went back to the counter to find a different manager I was told that Nicole is it I waited some more After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in   i pointed out that as people look through the bag   watches are being mixed up I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps After going through each bag I could not find the correct band Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference Nicole said no I get as is but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and dateNow I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price Thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watchPissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer DadA great way to spend the night  Loved the seafood salad with soba noodles   Asian cloppino and the filet have never disappointed  Would love to try everything on the menuGot an amazing facial here I have been there for a pedicure and massage in the past Its greatI have found my new favorite lounge here in Scottsdaleand I dont have to drive down to Old Town Stone Rose is the innovative creation of the Gerber Group  by infusing Scottsdales nightlife with cuttingedge design signature cocktails and a dash of glamour  all within a unique indooroutdoor settingA large outdoor bar is surrounded by couches and fire pits and beautifully landscaped  The indoor portion of the barlounge has wooden floors and ceilings with black leather couchesmaking for a retro 1950s feelStone Rose is absolutely beautiful within the Fairmont Princess grounds  With another NYC lounge opening here in Scottsdale I am beginning to feel more at home here in the desertFor all you folks that live here in North Scottsdale we finally have a poshlaid back loungeSimply the most unique night life experience that Charlotte has to offerIf you dont like 80s music or similarly dont have any sense of humor or humility this place isnt for you  There are dozens of meat market dance clubs available in the Uptown area  However if youre looking for a place to get drunk and dance to Micheal Jackson hits or sip a beer and watch replays from 80s dunk competitions this place is going to thrill you  Most important the vibe here is unlike any dance club Ive been to  Youre far more likely to see a Sid Vicious lookalike or a break dancing session form in the middle of the floor than you are to see a shoving match or a fight break out  80s music has a way of draining the aggression from testosterone pumped drunkards  And that provides for the most enjoyable dancing experience Ive had in CharlotteEveryone looks ridiculous when they dance to 80s music  So if youre accustomed like I am of looking ridiculous when you dance youll love The Breakfast ClubWe love the PrioryI dont remember how we found this place but I feel so lucky we did  A beautiful restoration of a lovely old building the Priory is a comfortable tasteful beautiful hotel in a convenient part of the city  We found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating plenty of help and advice for weary holiday travelers always delivered with a smile  We will return to the PrioryBe careful The servers cant pay attention to save their lives and the management cares even less I want to make sure people know how careless the management is particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run aroundHorrible TerribleOverpriced Tipical colombian place But the food not good enough The service really bad slow and poor They can offerd more because they cantFast cars I hoped for less sharp turns to hit them faster Use a coupon or you will get charged high prices for one lap Long wait Check in first then go somewher else while you waitNothing special The Mekong Palace still better but this is my second dim sum Still lookingStay away Far awayI had been hearing about Fate for a while I had high expectations since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past the owners prev joint which was OKIt was the worst ChineseAsian Ive had in AZ the service was terrible the chairs uncomfortable and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning and has been sick for the last 2 days from it I took her to the ER this morning at 430 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since Ive been a lurker for a whileAestheticsInitially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city Nice patio cool inside  However The seating at a bus stop is more comfy There is no chair back  just this high bar thing that digs into your backIm going to file this under aesthetics  we ordered the Hot and Sour soup more on that later and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share However they apparently dont have any kind of serving utensil so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine WTFServiceI dont know a nicer way to say it our waitress was a dopey bimbo It took 20 minutes for her to take our order She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some Not goodFoodI ran into a friend there and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didnt like it To be blunt it was utter crap The hot and sour soup was thin and spicy Thats it It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar no other flavors present Its not like any hot and sour soup I ever had in a bad way There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg I ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofuMy dish was bad The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy and totally lacked flavor As for basil there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish and thats it The sauce was thin and one dimensional Her lemon grass dish was also bad The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water I felt bad for the poor abused tofuIm not a big fan of chain restaurants but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste Screw that even the chinese place in the mall food court is better I am not exaggerating It was a very disappointing mealNow for the nasty partI drank water  Fiancee unit drank th Green Tea It was like no other green tea I ever had seen It was leprechaun green with some kind of milk like substance in itI thought it looked kinda funky but she drank itIt was the only difference between our meals I tried hers she tried mine etc I didnt drink the science experiment teaWell Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but shes missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm I took her to the ER at 430 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got and recovered from a tropical disease so her immune system is not at its strongest right now but come on This shouldnt be the end result Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems if you know what I mean due to lifestyle choicesThere is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th aveThe Cultural Center has a few great places esp Golden Buddha Thai Lahna has been consistently good for yearsLike I said I dont eat a lot of chain food  but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food qualityHelloAnd I hope this review does exactly what I intend for it to do Get the principals of this joke for a restaurant  who ever they are  to read it and wake up Obviously they must be eating the dog food they have been fed by others who rave about this placeLets start at the beginning went for lunch walked in saw people at tables so waited to see if an employee would be directing us NOPE nothing of the sorts walked up to an outdoor menu over a entrance again what do I do next People inside look at you but dont ask to help you We had our dog with us so I asked my girlfriend to go in and see what she can find out She walked to the counter and again no one would help Can I order Then a person replied and pointed you start down there Okay great were getting somewhere She placed an order for a salad premade crushed into a small container a chicken salad sandwich and a lemonade she came out and handed me the salad and drinks and said  lets find a table I have to go over to another area to wait for the sandwich  I sat down at a table with our dog outdoors next to  32nd street This is a farm and she went to get the sandwich  OH the daymare has just started After about 20 minutes she sent me a text and said I havent left you still waiting This is Chicken Salad People slap it on the bread add some lettuce and tomatoes and its ready to go Heres where it gets really good several people who arrived after us are getting their food from the mystery window by the red umbrella My girlfriend has now been standing there 30 minutes waiting she taps on the window and asks  is there a problem with the chicken salad  Ill check  the window closes and 10 minutes later the window opens revealing the sandwich  Now I would say this is possibly a one off scenario except right before she received our sandwich another person who had been waiting said he was on 37 minutes and then another person came up while she was receiving her sandwich and said how long does it take to get a tuna sandwich he had been waiting 30 minutesWe eat what I would say is ordinary fresh food nothing to write home about and because I found the concept of standing and waiting 40 minutes to get an average sandwich so ridiculous I stopped back in to express myself and politely said  This is our first time here and your service was awful and we will never returnTheir response exactly like the whole experience started NOTHINGAnd although we typically know what items cost before we eat anywhere so initially the price seemed okay but this place is definitely OVERPRICEDCame here for dinner with the family and I loved it I think I heard something about new management because you can definitely tell The service was outstanding very kind and friendly staff The food was great as well The portions are more plentiful now Will definitely be coming more often and recommending it to all my friendsThe Avenue is just classic Went there this weekend with friends Their fish fry is great  but we went for steaks and prime rib Some of the best in town easily I love their shrimp too I agree with Joe R   its far from health food I went with the baked potato instead of the hash browns just to lower my total grease intake Very good food and great atmosphere and serviceseriously this place is 4 star I think theres a secret in making boba Definitely this is not the place How can anybody mess up a watermelon slush  Yikes Donot come here for boba pleaseWonderful hidden gem in Charlotte  My husband and I spent our wedding night there  the breakfast the next morning was outstanding  I would highly recommend this for a romantic evening or wedding nightBy far the worst gay nightclub in phoenix and trust me I know gay nightclubs Lol no seriously this place is crap I have been suckered to come here a few times for a birthday party and some other events and its no fun the drag show is lame or the acts I have seen are the Dj is good plays some different tunes the ac is non existent I think they use a swamp cooler The bathroom is the size of a toilet stall and always packed that u have to piss in the alley where there is plenty of hookers at your disposal The drinks are expensive watered down and even the soda tasted funny the bar tender was very nice and friendly Never tried the food outside but I hear its great the parking is another disaster there is limited space and the night we went there was a few break ins in the back parking lot near liquor store Just being honest but the bad outweighs the good at this club give it a shot at your own risk but remember I warned youThis show was definitely NOT what we are used to for comedythe reasoncomedy was absentIf you are looking for standup comedy improvisational or not this is not the place This is a comedy troupe being generous on the word comedy here There are no tables just rows of chairsbut that is because there is no drink service This is more geared to the 12  20 crowd with sodas and candy bars for sale and simply some place to hang out on a Saturday nightAnd this was the late show Really wish we could get back that 90 minutes of lifebut it is gone forever The place was full largely 12  25 crowd So someone likes itbut we will not be backUghwhere to beginthis was such a waste of time My friends and I attended a Friday night adult puppet show just curious to see what it would be like I am glad it was only 8 I felt like apologizing to everyone afterward  because the entire show was so disappointingThe jokes were not witty the skits were disorganized and one of them just sad no one laughed the entire time For example one of the skits was about a gay pirate What is funny about this How is this an adult theme Just because he is gay it is an adult theme Another skit involved a jilted Cinderellatype character who was angry that her Prince Charming left her for a man Again its adultthemed because hes gay Ok just not funny Another lowpoint in the show was the improv skit where they asked the audience for a topic and just went with it The only word I can think of to express what happened is cringeworthy So what did I expect from an adult puppet show Well FUNNY jokes that I have not heard before and werent funny just because theyre gross I expected intelligent humor maybe innuendo and some wit I dont mind cursing or sexual humor at all just wanted it to not be solameDate  Time of Visit  May 21 DinnertimeI dont know what this place was thinking with their eightyfivedollar eightcourse tasting menu  That menu had microscopicsize courses and the taste after the first two 2 courses were repetitiveand mostly on the sweet side  Moreover the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants  As for their restroom only one and a unisex one at that  And yes there was urine on the floorFirst if there is a way to give zero stars I would give it I took my friends with his kids and my family there for lunch while visiting the city for a trade show Shame on me for not reading the reviewsWaiter The waiter like others reported on their reviews was the owner He was rude impatient and not interested in providing a traditional service My son is only tow years old and ordering a whole meal would have been a waste So I politely asked if I could have an extra plate Waiter was fast to add that he charges 5 for sharing a plate The first time I heard of such foolish charge  Our table was in an area where the waiter couldnt reach three of my guests and we told him that we can pass things down to him He got upset and made a snappy remark Food  The food was about average  Most of us ordered the same dish and we all had meat that were not cooked all the way We mentioned it to him at the end of our meal just to bring it to his attention All and all the experience was horrible and I do t recommend this to anyoneI have to stop myself from stopping here once a week and stocking up on cards I dont yet need Great card selection and perfect for gift shopping they literally have something for everyone  I go at least as often as I need a card for some occasion and they always have new things A bit expensive but worth it to support this great storeThis is my local hang out when I come through VegasGreat food great staff good drink prices and the staff is awesomeTrish is GreatOpera is Fun Yes it is Tosca yesterday was amazing I was riveted through the whole thing  and at almost 4 hours including 2 intermissions thats saying something I was wowed by the singing enjoyed the sets was impressed by the acting and intrigued by the story Floria Tosca was superb Scarpia and Spoletto deliciously evil Honestly I did not expect to LIKE opera as much as I have but Ive been enthralled with both AZ Opera performances Ive seen this year The Mikado and Tosca particularly Tosca After the performance an opera QA session was held for anyone wishing to stay The AZ opera head and tenor James Flora answered questions about everything from the set the directors mindset the Spoletto characters triumphant ending and the future of opera in the United StatesThis is a very dumpy club Some closets the bar area and the mens room might be bigger I would call it intimate but it has no intimacy it is like an afterthought They have one bathroom with one toilet each for men and women  that must be a code violation It was like seeing a show in your buddies garage and a bad show at that On this night I donated 10 bucks to watch Bob Howard and Friends which was actually some old lawyer moonlighting as a comedian The rest of Bobs friends were old and older and I did not manage to laugh once except at the dude who was wearing a fishing hat that Bob Newhart probably owned That same moron would not accept my two buck off coupon at the door claiming it was a special night A bunch of amateur comedians at a 6pm show does not sound too special to me Out of respect for a date I had to wait until after the show to heckle this guy His whole 15 minute act was asking the front row of people what they did and making fun of them an act of a child I felt much better when I heckled him in the hallway asking him if he knew any jokes and he had no response The two drink minimum is not mentioned until you sit in your seat and on this night the waitress overcharged me for a beer on special She lost out on a tip Poor staff poor comedy poor venue  go to a real comedy club unless you are a good heckler because you might be star of the show at that pointI dont come here for the food or because its a nice and trendy place I come here because Im a US Marine even the good drinks are cheap and Im surrounded by my brothers Very simpleWhen making a Customers paymento atLowes we have our checklist1 Do the phone numbers match  Nope but thats fine since people are always changing their phone numbers anyways2 Does the name on account match name on check  Nope but mistakes happen at those pesky check companies3 Does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen  Why should it those computers are always making mistakesNow that we have verified that all the information is correct we can process the payment  The customer will be so happy that we didnt have to bother them with any silly questionsI am sad to say that this is an actual occurrence  What was originally an average Lowes has turned into Lowes Hell  If the associates do not have basic logic comprehension how do they surviveIve been to the Glass Center perhaps 5 or so times now Ive gone for a toursdemonstrations and two Make It Now classes I have thoroughly enjoyed going each and every time Some of the art they have on display is fantastic It was interesting the last time I went because local artists were there to sell glass work they madeThe Make It Now classes are well worth 25 You get to be somewhat involved in creating the object You get to pick the color blow the glass and do a couple of other things You never get too hot to the ovens or do anything dangerous at all If you want to be more involved there are other more advanced classes that you can take plus you have a wonderful piece of art to take home Ive made an ornament and pumpkin so far and will be making a flower soon The instructors have all been very nice and helpful as well making the experience even betterI cant wait to go backI have been going to Great Wall since 1983 It has always been great and its the restaurant by which I judge all other Chinese restaurants It is consistent reasonably prices good services and delicious food The staff is very courteous and I am always well served If I ever do have a problem they are more than compliant Great placeHusband and I were out with some friends on Saturday night and decided to hit this place up around 9pm When we rolled in we were SHOCKED at the 5 cover charge Who else has it so cheap GREAT START to our evening We easily found some nice seats on couches towards the back but the place is smallish so we had awesome views of the larger stage It was kinda disappointing with the first couple dancers because they seemed to be more interested in staring at themselves in the mirrors to see how hard they could frown so it got a few doubts going but then some AMAZING dancers blew our minds Two girls in particular stuck with us for a while and gave us ALL lap dances and did some really crazy tricks on the chairs 7 lap dances sign us up We all agreed who needs Christies 20 dances when we can get gorgeous ladies and great music here BTWThe music was just FABULOUS Lots of variety lil rap not much lots of rock like Metallica lil punk so everyone in our group was rocking out hardcorein more ways then one  Guys girls lesbians we saw a fewno matterThe Candy Store will take care of you all D Go get your jelly watch onI was so excited to get my hair cut  colored because of the great reviews on here I wish I could be one of the very happy customers but unfortunately I am not Hair cut It was okay She seemed like she was in a hurry  for the price I should have gone somewhere else Color The dye that is actually on my hair looks nice but the dye is also ALL OVER my face my forehead my neck I can understand a bit on my forehead but why are there streaks of dye on my cheek On my EYELID When Felice the owner was dying my hair the dye was flying everywhere I give two stars because the place was easy to find  Felice seemed like a nice lady Also they offer other services there I a lot of products But I will not be going backEdited to one star because I found a ton of dye IN my ear  now I am pissed off I could have done a better job then she didOver staffed but there is never anyone to help me look at something I am potentially going to buy No bargaining whatsoever not even if the item has been there foreverI would like a job choreographing the water  How does one make that happenIm a fan of the Sinatra and some of the opera routines but the other ones have got to go BlehIve already choreogrpahed a number to Clark Gable by The Postal ServiceAnd I seriously need a job  This one would be perfect if it wasnt in Las Vegas  BlehGreat pizza on mondays deal499 for a large pizza with cheese off of EatCucomI got a large with half steak and half italian beefLet me say it was the most delicious hearty pizza I have ever had for 6 bucks I usually get Papa Johns large pineapple for 5 bucks but it gets old This is good Italian pizza as italian as they say they areAnyway I keep reading all these rave reviews about the chicken tenders and as I waited for my pizza multiple people came in and ordered those chicken tenders so they must be goodBut back to my pizza it was AMAZING I took 2 slices and and im not even hungry anymore THis baby is gonna last me for the rest of the night and at least 1 slice for breakfast tomorrow55 stars AMy husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway What a neat place Its a european style hotel read very nice but smaller rooms It used to be a monestary back in the day Built around the turn of the century it has neat large old molding and furnishings Owner was very nice offers complimentary wine in the evening and good full continental breakfast All of that for only 135 a night A short ride from everything Includes free parkingGreat little sushi place worth trying Im vegetarian so I can only speak for the vegetarian dishes but its tasty fresh and easyI cant say enough about Merantes and Maria The back of the shop has wonderful baked goods Pies breads and of course the best biscotti around Though the true treasure exists in the upstairs apartment where Maria has cooking classes and serves a 6 course meal to parties of  810 most nights of the week I heard about the private parties while at a food tour of Bloomfield I knew I needed to get a reservation but I had no idea how difficult that task would be We scheduled a dinner in October for the first available Friday or Saturday which was 6 months later Thats right folks 6 months in advance The menu changes seasonally and is posted on the website We ordered earlier in the week so that Maria had time to purchase the necessary items and prepare our meal The menu would typically be the same for all 8 in the party but Maria graciously offered to allow us to split the entrees into a meat and a non meat option to allow those who dont eat meat on Fridays during lent to have another option When we arrived we all enjoyed the appetizers in a sitting room at the front of the apartment The appetizers themselves were a meal meatballs bread shrimp spinach pie stuffed tomatoes and cheese with roasted peppers all of which were incredible Bring along your wine as Merantes is BYOB The next course was soup which we were served in the formal dinning room which opened to the small kitchen where Maria cooks your meal At first it was a little awkward sitting so close to the kitchen and Maria Imagine having dinner at your grandmothers home with 7  of your closest friends But Maria did a great job of giving us our privacy We hardly even noticed that she was there After the soup came the pasta homemade gnocchi anyone then the entrees and vegetables then the salad and last the dessert This was a meal fit for a king The portions were huge Luckily Maria boxed up the leftovers making for an easy lunch the next day If your lucky you may even get to take home a little extra something such as extra sauce or a homemade truffle Absolutely everything about this dinner was perfection Everything from the food to the service and hospitality was done with the utmost care and concern to ensure a wonderful experience I would literally come here every month if it were possible Unfortunately Maria is booked through the end of 2014 Not one day available in the next 8 months My only complaint Maria is in serious need of a cloneMy favorite Vegas Strip comedy club  The comics are always funny and the price is right compared to the Improv at Harrahs LA has a more modern look than the outdated RivieraThe ice is bad This place is run downSome of the instructors need to remember that the customer pays money for lessons therefore pays their salary so they should loose the attitude That goes for pretty much everyone that works thereThe Ice Den is soooooo much betterBob Ludwig at Blumengarten is the best I had a last minute event for which I needed very specific flowers I called in to make sure they had orchids which they got just for me in less than a day I wanted to pick the rest on site but got there with a few minutes left until closing time and in a rush to deliver them myself Bob made me a beautiful arrangement at a reasonable price very quickly I am going to go here for all my future flower needsFigure Id give Supercuts a shot since Giant Eagle sells their gift cards so it is great for fuelperks  I dont remember her name but she is one of the bigger woman there  I wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy  So I asked her for a trim to get the sidesback cleaned up  She said ok and off she goes  5 minutes later we were done   Yes just like a bad date we were done in 5 minutesI got home showered and saw the damage  It was messy  Whats worst is every day it grows it looked even worstIll just stick to my usual barberI have been a student of the True Buddha School most of my life The School is global with the main headquarters in Redmond Washington I recently moved to Charlotte and was so pleased there was a temple here The people here are some of the nicest Ive met The services are all mostly conducted in Chinese and the attendees are also mostly Chinese so it can be very disconcerting for nonChinese speakers Dont be intimidated Culturally there are differences but everyone is good people  On a daytoday basis the English is limited but we definitely have quite a few English speakers dotted within If you have questions or want to learn more please feel free to call or stop by and try and make an appointment with an English speaker We are usually there on Sundays Regular weekly service usually group cultivation  meditation is from 111 You can feel free to come by and observe and we can try and answer any questions you have before or afterwards And you would be more than welcome to stay for lunchThere are also a number of books and brochures available that have been translated to English Printed words only get you so far The best thing to do is to track down an Englishspeaker and ask everything youve ever wanted to ask There are no stupid questions only teachers who may not know the best answer Currently and at least through the end of the year 2014 we have a dharma class being taught in English from 130 to 3 It gets into some of the nitty gritty of Buddhism so if you are a beginner Id recommend talking to someone before jumping into class Either way anyone and everyone is welcomeTBS is open to everyone Chinese or not and of any religious backgroundOur spiritual leader is Living Buddha Lian Sheng Our dharma and our practice encompasses all Buddhist schools of Mahayana Hinayana and mostly Vajrayana While other temples and societies may practice differently we all believe in the same basic precepts of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold PathLet me just tell you I have really really difficult hair  type 3b Naturally curly 100 grey I dye it dark and mess with the color myself  never good  If you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair Since I have been going to Mane Attractions I have really LOVED my hair I have been going there for about 4 years Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet  you curly girls know what I am talking about I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom who is always honest is impressed The only complaint I ever have is that yes sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week I just know to call and schedule things it is a small business and I get it  PS kids haircuts are only 10 and My daughter loves itMy sister has a bucket list  and from this bucket list I bought her Christmas gift this year One of her items was to learn how to make sushi I asked around and found Crate A friend of mine had taken a sushi class there and LOVED it so I had total confidence in buying the class for my sister and I to do together When I first searched they didnt have a sushi class on the schedule I emailed them to find out and they said to check back in the spring As I was scrambling two weeks before Christmas to figure something else out to get my sister they emailed ME and said that they added a sushi class for February and for me to go register so Id have it in time for my sister for Christmas It was really nice because I had already started looking for something else so great on the sales end on their partThere were 18 people in our class and we were in the demonstration kitchen We learned how to roll three different types of sushi and all of the steps that go along with it Everyone had such a great time making their own sushi and eating it too I signed up for the email newsletter and Im already thinking of occasions to rent it out for private parties It made a great gift my sister loved itI used to live in the area and would always patronize and recommend this business  However with the last experience I will have to rethink that My aunt and uncle ordered a gift basket for my grandmother for her birthday When it was delivered it looked beautiful  However once opened not so much  Inside it was filled withDollar General brand goods When I stopped down to tell them the owner and another worker told me what do you expect If it was a busy season we would have gotten stuff from the strip So moral of the tale If you want to pay a whole lot of money for stuff from the Dollar Store you know where to go To make it even more special the owner will provide a blank stare and a warm welcoming attitude that clearly shows she does not careI cant begin to describe how much i hate this placePretty much its full of people who think money is everything bitching on about others and drinking cocktails that cost more than the extortionate entry fee GrrThe student nights arent too bad if you catch it on a good week  but most of the time its just hammered first years and on all the other nights its odd business men trying to get with the younger girls Not goodThe bar is self is a bit crap  its atmosphere is like walking in on your parents doing it has no charm but attempts to cover these major flaws with tacky bling and various other furnishingsAvoid if you value your moralsI lived in Madison for a couple years Now that I have moved away there are a couple things that I sincerely miss Sausages from Bavaria Sausage Inc are some of those things This place is amazing It is outside the main part of the city but it isnt too far away Do yourself a favor and purchase some delicious tubular meats from these guys The cheese is pretty tasty as wellThe Harmony hours listed are dead wrong and they are open not closed Makes me wonder about the factcheckers at yelp do they have anyThis is the first time Ive been here  First of all the Singapore Noodles was the best I have ever tasted in my life and Ive had several  The waitress was great  The bus boy literally came around every 5 minutes to make sure everyone had water and he took the dirty dishes away right away  I dont mind saying I may eat here again tomorrowI went to the Sunday night Salsa lessons at Paragon There were about 200 people for the salsa group lessons It was a noisy zoo Men far outnumbered women but during the course of the lesson it almost evened out Lots of partner switching  in fact switching is almost all we did That has its advantages if your main goal is to hold hands with lots of partners I have certainly heard a lot of hype about Paragon but the studio left me kind of cold I dont see how anybody could learn to dance there The quality of instruction isnt close to other local studios I have been to Of course maybe the instruction was better than I knew since it was almost impossible to see or hear the instructor and individual attention is out of the question I gave them another try on a Thursday for a West Coast Swing lesson The quality of instruction wasnt good and we had distractions because other group lessons and privates were given in the same ballroom They have other small ballrooms so there was little excuse to cram everybody into the main ballroom I watched a private lesson and wasnt impressed by what I saw Paragon is probably popular because of the dances after the lessons but the music wasnt for beginners So if you want to learn dancing go somewhere else for meat markets do Paragon Their prices and quality will appeal to anyone who thinks McDonalds is a great dealLove Little Tokyo Dedicated customers keep the place full all week long and on the weekends If cleanliness is important to you this is the restaurant you want You could safely eat off the floors Staff is friendly but unobtrusive A definite favoriteI discovered this today at my local Farmers Market and I am now addicted I dont think I can ever go back to store pasta They had samples of the spinach basil garlic pasta and it was delicious When we asked what sauce they used I was shocked to hear just butter and a pinch of salt  all of the flavor came from the pasta itselfIn response to the response I received from the Museum rep I called and left a message and never received a reply as of yet but you reponded on Yelp This week is the 3rd week your response stated that my refund was sent this week if you are speaking about this current week today is the 14th monday and the week has just begun If you are talking about last week can you please tell me what day since leaving messages do not gain a response except to be contacted here on Yelp Thank youMy family has been coming here for over 20 years and Ive always had a great meal Great specials diversity and service I think this is the best Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area The best egg drop soup Ive ever hadBy far my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte  Have been going to Great Wall for the past 12 years and no Chinese place in Charlotte has come close to replacing itFood has always been good and is always consistent  From the egg drop soup to the spring rolls to the entrees everything is great  I highly recommend the Shrimp and Broccoli but really everything there is worth tryingWait staff is very attentive bordering on too attentive at times  Food comes out fast and hot  The owner is friendly and enjoys chattingGood with large parties there are two rooms in the back of the restaurant that can be joined or separated depending on the size of your partyFor some reason I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress Maybe I was just selfconscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place ABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured ABD has a great selection of mattresses and the prices cannot be beat I picked up a full plush pillowtop mattress for a cool 375 without a box spring or a frame since I already had one Better yet Delivery is free AND prompt You pick a threehour timeframe and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a onehour slot so youre not sitting around all afternoonI highly recommend taking this course It may be expensive but its hard to put a price on driving skills that could save your life or the lives of your friendsfamilies For how much time we all spend in cars it sure doesnt hurt to have superior command of your vehicleI learned a lot in my course For example I learned about weighting the individual tires of my car particularly through a turn I also got experience steering out of a black spin Sure the odds of getting into a situation like this are low but I like to think that I will remain calm and return my vehicle to safety should I ever find myself in this position Also its fun I still think of Bondurant skills today  years after taking the course  and hope that I can do the program again in another 10 years or so Highly recommendCopious samples garnish the aisles Local flavor is found at every turn Then theres the annual selection of selection of World Championship cheeses Brennans is the single most place that I recommend all who visit Madison to visit Plenty of people drive along the many cheese barns of the interstate only to find a selection of novelty items and subpar cheeses So if youre not from the area and you find yourself in town this is your chance to learn what cheese in Wisconsin is all about The smoked mozzarella sticks find me every timeMy second home filled with my second family I became a member September 13 and have completely changed my life for the better This is the place to be on Wednesday and Saturdays for Buddhism 101 It is a very clean facility I wish the bookstore was bigger The people inside are the realist and kindest people you will ever come acrossYou better know what youre getting into which is totally awesome 80s and cheap ass drinks away from the frattiness of uptown Dont be scared its a blastAwful The sweat panted  hey put a little effort in to it  crabby  if you you think your job sucks find a different one   barista  being able to work an espresso machine is not that much more difficult than a mr coffee at least gave me some fodder for crappy service reviews Lazy dirty and angry is no way to garner tips I didnt drink the coffee afraid she spit in itThis is my new goto place for pampering Lots of services to choose from Im still exploring the options but I love my facials by Wendy Top notch pro And Maryanns vascular treatment for facial blemishes is nothing short of amazing Theres a bit of a healing process to plan for but the results are remarkable The support staff is warm and friendly the spa area is cozy and relaxing and mimosas are served as you prepare to  let your cares melt away The spa is a challenge to find the first time but well worth the effort to keep looking Next time Ill be back for a couples spa day Cant waitI love this place Friendly staffGreat FacialsGreat Permanent MakeupGreat AtmosphereReally everyone Just 4 stars Crows Dairy gets 5 They have the best chevre Ive ever tasted Consistently excellent smooth texture The flavor has the nice tanginess of goat cheese but its very smooth and clean Some goat cheeses can get a little too overwhelming Ive been buying them at a various local farmers markets for a while Since Im slow on the uptake I didnt realize it was available on the shelves of the Phoenix Public Market every day of the week Now that I know that Ill be eating it much more frequently YumI absolutely love Perry Monge Salon  I have been going there since 2004 and it has never disappointed  The entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home  Marina is amazing with hairI only wish she could style my hair every morning  The extra perks beyond an amazing hair cut are the chair massage before your wash and the hand massage during your cut  I spend 75 of my time in Dallas and 25 of my time in Phoenix but insist on only having my hair cut at Perry MongeWhat a wonderful experience Wonderful ride great pilot and overall very much worth our money Patrick was our pilot and he was very friendly and informative He managed to ease everyone who had concerns about heights We all had a wonderful flight from the Carefree Highway down to the Deer Valley Airport It was nice to finish the whole thing off with champagne and breakfast I would definitely recommend to my friends and I hope to do it again somedayI bought Groupons for Unicorn Balloon Company to help my mother fulfill one of the items on her bucket list I was a bit worried as I had read a lessthanstellar review but ultimately I was impressed by the professionalism of this company We had no problems using the Groupons and making the reservations a few months in advance We met the van at the designated time and they took us to the launch site checking the air currents for the best launch site They allowed nonriders to follow to the site as well Our pilot Capt John Bagwell was very knowledgeable and personable telling humorous stories interspersed with ballooning facts He also took video of the flight which will be available via email at no extra cost  something most ballooning companies do not do Our flight lasted about 1 12 hrs and apparently our chase truck had a flat tire so was a bit late getting to the landing site though others in view did not We did tip on landing but at the current windspeed that was to be expected and the pilot warned us that it would happen Note re previous reviewer the chase crew does not help you land We had a champagne toast and continental breakfast as they presented certificates A very nice morning indeedUpdate Shadyside Inn refunded the charges from our stay  They report they are adding staff and upgrading their facilitiesIn response to the managers comments  As I noted above they refunded our stay  The TV cabling is exposed perhaps not as dangerous as exposed electrical wire but not something to be particularly proud of if you consider yourself to be a business built on customer service and the impression of luxury The ongoing repairs in the hallways were not touched during our middle of the week stay so one must wonder about the urgency of those repairs   The building we stayed in was not full  Why did they put my family in the oldest most dilapidated room As far as moving to a different room any one who has traveled with children would know how difficult  it is to move from one hotel or hotel room to another  We arrived after a 3 hour drive at 5pm in the middle of a thunderstorm with a very tired and cranky toddler  Given the relative level of competence at the front desk at the time of check in we werent confident that any room we would be moved to would be any betterI stand behind my review  If I could give the place zero stars I wouldThis place is awesome it has a indoor outdoor pool area exercise room indoor basketball court rock climbing wall dance classroom kitchen room pilateyoga room dance room exercise room indoor track playroom for children minutes away from public library shopping center 45 star hotel resort and office buildings and parks and trails  There are many outdoor and indoor activities for all ages  Definitely a must see for new residence and visitorsI thought this pretty good A little spendy but if you take your time and really see everything it not that bad  We went through the whole thing twice  Definitely a must see but it will be awhile before my next tripThe atmosphere was fun Our chef was very nice and entertaining The filet was excellent  Their salad dressing is a little harsh for my taste  Over all it was a great time I will definitely go backGotta love Lucys And I do Great selection of wines yummy snacks and bar pies  really where else can you go for a 100 wine and pizza I say that a bit sarcastically  as I always get a bit ahead of myself and pick out a great wine because really life is to short to drink bad wine  My husband rolls his eyes when I suggest Lucys cause I am not a cheap date there but he likes it too He even threw a surprise bday party for me there recently  and it was all perfect The back patio is super when the weather is nice and they have cozy couches inside or a table if you prefer Check it out its funThis place is so awesome  Very fresh cuts of meat great customer service knowledgeable employees what more can you ask for  They are always willing to go the extra mile here  On one occasion I bought meat for a stir fry and the employee offered to cut up the meat for me without me even having to ask  Another time I was looking for salmon fillets and the fish had just gotten there and one of the employees cut me a fillet  I highly recommend this placeI really do like their chicken strips  My previous review is still accurate but the last time I went the management change shows and the new service staff is slow and inefficient  The place was always borderline sketchy but with the new folks it seems to have plummeted and I recently saw their Champaign county restaurant inspection reports and they have been failing them with pretty egregious offensesDont get me wrong most restaurants have issues and even fail these inspections but issues with hot water spoiled foods and pestsI wont be headed back anytime soonFirst of all this place is phenomenal  I have a membership to the Morrison close to work but decided to come try out Dowd on the weekend since its so close to my houseI walked in and asked where the cardio machines are  The staff member behind the counter let me know that they have a few cardio machines in the Womens locker room and the rest were on the next floor  I walked into the locker room just to check out the machines imagining a treadmill next to the shower and was SHOCKED  And I really do mean I was floored  The Womens locker room has to be about 2000 sq ft  Its enormous  There is basically a Womens gym inside the locker room  I fell in love  Lockers a Jacuzzi showers mirrors to get ready hair dryers a cardio room changing rooms weight machines yoga mats a tv and more  Holy crap did I just die and go too gymheavenNeedless to say I didnt actually make it out of the Womens locker room to see the rest of the building  In my defense I didnt really need to  They had everything I needed right there  What a wonderful place  I will definitely be backTonight I cheated on Elianas with Guanaquito I still feel a bit guilty as Ive been with Elianas for years but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way how can you fault me If you blink youll miss it on McDowell between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services You need to park in back accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for GuanaquitoLike Elianas its Salvadoran cuisine but there are so many more options at Guanaquito They serve breakfast lunch and dinner and based on tonights sampling Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata It sure was maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique For his entree Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter a tamale again quite different from a Mexican tamale softer and creamier 2 pastales meat pies and 2 pupusas stuffed grilled tortillas Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elainas and they were every bit as good The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant which to me had an asparagusy taste Definitely delicious At both Salvadoran places we were served a bowl of cabbage salad but at Elianas we had never been told how to eat it Guanaquitos was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas I was skeptical at first but became quickly hooked It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas and added a nice crunch and zing The only thing I found that Elianas did better than Guanaquito was the flan Guanaquitos texture was off but the flavor was acceptableI suppose Im willing to share my new love with all of you but be forewarned shes a saucy mistress youll be compelled to visit again and again Oh and shes cheap too Hubby and I got out of there for 24 and that includes the extras I got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrowI hate Fate  My fate at Fate has always been to have a mediocre meal that takes too long  Dont even bother with a group as it only makes the servers even more surly than normal and the food even slower to arriveThe last time I was there I was with a group bad idea per my comment above  Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild  When the food came every dish on the table was nuclear hot  I can handle hot food but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos  When we mentioned this to our server she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time  She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary Duh but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food  Therefore the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency  Frankly any chef who doesnt taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of workThe concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great  Sadly Fate falls apart in its executionIts a lot less flashy but you get a consistent meal at China Chili where they also know how to regulate the heat in their food  Apparently their chefs actually taste their dishesSlow service staff needs more training Theres like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing i dont think this place is going to make it Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer serviceWill never darken their doorway again I moved to the area four months ago and have surprisingly had a difficult time finding a place to buy fresh meat I am used to the Amish markets in MD I tried this place and was completely ignored from the moment I stepped into to the door My visit was short and not sweet at all I wish there was an option to not give a single starWARD is the best bartender I hope that when I grow up one day I can be JUST like him When he tells stories theyre so amazing youll want to hear them twice My husband and I both got sick after eating here  How come there is always a line on the weekendAlways a long wait to see the doctor Today waited an hour and a half with no one updating me with ones going on or an apology Went to get a refund of my copay and still no apology or even an option of let me see how much longer Becky may be great but the front staff will keep me from going back Never happy with the staff every time Ive gone and this what the icing on the cakeI will never buy any type of Italian sausage at Giant Eagle again because now i know what real sausage tastes like  And the deli counter guy at Giant Eagle doesnt inappropriately and amusingly call me babe every five seconds like the ones at Penn Mac do   Ordering hot italian sausage from a deli guy that calls you babe is as amusing as Sunday morning can get       Ill keep coming here for fresh meats and cheeses as long as I live in PittsburghI didnt like this placeFirst the service is slowSecond the food is not that goodGyros are below the average and chicken is too greasy I dont wanna talk about friesSo this place is so overratedPlease dont go here Im begging you I wouldnt wish this place on my own worst enemy I wouldnt wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend This place was a literal nightmare I think Ive been to Jimmy Wans 4 times this month so I was sick of it Plus Id heard good things about TaiPei so I thought Id give it a whirlThe service was abysmal  my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize Id sat down He was very kind but only dropped my food off No hows it going no water refills no offer of dessert or other courses A kind busboy kept refilling my drink The portions are extremely small  Ive never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life The menu says theres a charge for fried rice instead of white Huh Jimmy Wans offers white and brown no extra charge InterestingThe atmosphere was atrocious  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child 6 or 7 mind you take off his shoes and walk around He then ground his heel into the carpet  with a piece of chicken in between He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet I audibly gasped but his obese mother couldnt hear me or ignored me Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didnt shut up The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night longThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didnt care at all My waiter didnt show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did after Id requested someone else get him he failed to clear my dirty plates I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was  namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy Youthink I want something to go How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order Howis that busyOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands If you care about your health dont go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesnt care if children grind chicken into the carpet If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cookingJews dont go here on Christmas even if though they loudly advertise theyre open If 15 people means theyre busy can you imagine what itll be like on ChristmasThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wans immediately before going to TaiPei  a 15 second drive between establishments Wans parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wans did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me the 15th person in their restaurantOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochistBefore i used to believe Bad Dim Sum was an old wives tale ment to scare children from the greasy steamed dishes of utter OMGWTFBBQPWNAGEness Thank you Cathay House for industrializing dim sum and making it as chinese as taco bell is to mexican foodLately in my review Ive been doing a breakdown of everything from how the place looks to me to listing what i ordered and what i thought of it Id rather not for this review because it would force me to stop lean over and vomit uncontrollably Gripes They sat us in what i call the shit hole section of the restaurant where small families less then a few people and generally those who dont look like theyre gonna spend a lot of money go to minimize chances of customers wasting their time and maximize profit Guess where the white people sat same cart different pusher to give the illusion they were well stocked you could taste how much effort they put into their food ive had chicken mcnuggets that have had more effort put into themoh look another cart that means they got more selectionDAMN IT those two just tradedDAMN YOUConclusionIf you feel like Dim Sum go somewhere elseIf you feel like eating what chinese people make to sell to foreigners by all means go here and order an Egg Foo Young and General Tsos Chicken and taste that authentic chinese goodnessEveryone loves fun At F1 Race Factory fun is their focus Safety is their MO I came here in the fall of 06 for a work function It was a teambuilding day so while we did have to meet in a room and talk shop the people at F1 made it very comfortable and easy We met in their big room with couches high tables and ample space for our meetings Breaks were then infused with team fun We actually got to split into groups and challenge each other  see who could be the fastest team to change 4 tires on a real thought retired race car My team placed 2nd It was great We got to do a practice run and then two real runs to let our lowest time qualify F1 was sure to have snacks and beverages handy after and before in case we worked up an appetite during the day Lunch was served here too Tasty hamburgers made to order After our meetings we got to go on the track Beforehand we sat through a brief safety video and explanation Then we were fitted for helmets and shown to where the action happens I was nervous I had never driven a gokart before and these were suppose to be the fastest indoor gokarts in Arizona Uhm yeah Lets just say I had no idea what I was doing Nobody explained the pedals to me so I just assumed they ran like a car I was right I took off not really knowing how many laps I had to do or where I was going There were friendly guys out on the track to wave flags  for wreck ahead slow down or even get out of the way of speeddevils behind ya I got the latter quite a bit At the very last of the race somebody sped by me to place ahead of me That means I placed last Thats okay It was my first time out there and while I spun my car around once or twice  and ran into the sides several times  I was just happy to be alive To make the race fun F1 gave us awards for 1st 2nd and 3rd I won an award too  for being the turtle on the track That was funny All in all I had a great time While I would probably not go to back to race Id go back to watch people race or hang out in the cafeteria area playing arcade games or munching on food This is DEFINITIVELY  a fun place to send your thrillseeking speed junkie friends You can get gift cards tooThis is a Fantastic Hardware Store I found a really old chrome 1930s FAN at trader jacks flea market last Sunday SUPER COOL FIND anyway  it had a dryrotted electric cord and a bad 3 speed pull chain type switchRolliers had an exact replacement for the switch and a retro vintage looking cloth covered electric cord I was very impressedThe Staff was very helpful and happy to assist me   unlike the jagoffs at lowes and home depotSupport Local  I cant stress this enough With some advice and tips from my favorite electronics store in Squirrel hill My fan is all cleaned up and running like a topZias is pretty much the equivalent of Newbury Comics the record store I frequented most back home in Boston  Now that Ive moved out here it was nice to find something so similar  re Chris R True a lot of people are done with CDs due to the changes in the music industry over the years  But for a lot of people you cant replace the experience of browsing a huge selection of artists at a place like thisIll go here and spend an hour or so until i have a stack of like 6 or 7 CDs then narrow it down to the best 3 or 4 finds to buy that day  Ive gotten a lot of good deals here and always enjoy myself  Staff is greatI have been a part of the Lohan School of Shaolin for 4 years now and it has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life When I first heard of the school my father took me in to watch the kung fu class and when I walked in I felt this really strong positive energy and right then and there I wanted to join The school is like a second home to me and the students are like another family If you are looking for a good traditional kung fu school this is definitely the place to goLocal tasty helpful What more could I ask for Dropped in on a busy Saturday Things were frantic but the employees were still helpful No need to buy grocery store or out of town coffee againWent there with two friends on a trip to Vegas and it was wonderful  Atmosphere top notch Staff was professional and friendly and prices reasonable  Definite stop in vegasI totally 100 agree w Serianna TI have felt the same way about the seating and parking and mediocre foods Postino and LGO are complete cluster Fs for anyone who plans on driving there I also feel like the general atmosphere is trying so hard to be relaxed and casual that it is stressful for the guestsThis place is so relaxing and quiet The staff is very nice and accommodating The grounds are very beautiful and I was able to walk to a nearby shopping center without any issue I am staying in a room that has a balcony and a swing  so relaxing Very nice BB Fits well into the southern hospitality feel of CharlotteThe worst food ever Ive been sick for two days after two bites of the tacos When will it end Ugh Okay drinks Kind of wateryWe recently had our wedding reception in the private room at McMullans  It was outstanding  The staff was friendly and helpful  The food was delicious  Best of all the prices were soooo reasonable  Our budget was tiny but we were able to have a full dinner including an open bar for our guestsBrian the owner stopped in to make sure that our party was going well and that everything was to our likingI picked McMullans off Yelp and Im sooo glad we didThey went out of their way to make sure that everything was perfect including creating a makeshift cake stand for my wedding cakeWe had the irish sausage rolls which were phenomenal as well as stuffed mushrooms chicken pot pie and the fish and chips  HIGHLY recommend the fish and chipsMy only complaint was that the main entrees werent served at the same time so people gobbled up the fish and chips in 2 seconds and some people had to wait 10 minutes before the next entree came out  That could have been timed a little better so that everyone could have gotten some of everything instead of it being staggered so muchAll in all though I highly highly highly recommend McMullansLife is a Cabaret old chumYou may come out singing life is a cabernet savignon after throwing back a couple here because yay you can drink and eat and eat and drinkI encourage anyone who loves musical theater or anyone who just likes to eat and drink in a fun environment to give this place a try  Its one of my favorite venues to see a show because its a whole experience  Theres not a bad seat in the house because it only holds about 200 tables  Plus they have VIP seating in the front which provides you with some comfy sofas to sit onIm very excited to see a new caterer come in since the companion restaurant closed next door  I wasnt too thrilled with the food selectionsI really dont know how you make Pizza badbut they somehow did  I loved The Big Bang and I Love You Youre Perfect Now Change  They honestly do a fantastic job casting the shows  I have my own personal favorites its my own personal fan club of oneKeep in mind theres discounts if you work for certain corporations youre a student or you come a in group  Everyone loves a discount  Go see something so you can stop singing the same Cabaret lyrics over and over again every time you think of the placeI went here years ago when I was young and enjoyed dancing I always felt sort of exposed the way the seating was There is that long row of bar stools that makes you feel on display Now I prefer listening to music rather than dancing to it except at home where I often break into dance for no reason whatsoever So now I say I love you Rhythm Room You make me feel like Goldilocks except without the long walk in the woods and home burglary part You are not to hot not to cold you are just right Not to big not to small again you got it right And I havent even broken a bar stool yet Nor have I fallen asleep while at the Rhythm Room I am done with the young hip scene I use to visit at the Emerald Lounge before it was turned into a Starbucks If I go someplace like that now it always seems too loud and my personal space always feels violated I still feel to young for the lounge act at Scottsdales blahblahblah so where do I fit in Where do I fit in Where can I go for good music and not stand out like a well just not stand out I dislike big crowds and arenas Small venues are fine if you are not the only audience member and will be missed if you need to get up to pee  The beer is cold but my friends who prefer a gin and tonic can also be taken care of The people who work there are nice no attitude and are actually very cool If it gets a little crowded or if you feel like chatting someone up they have a patio Finally I have found a place where I can blend in and listen to the music I love Bowerbirds check St Vincent check Now if you could just book Grizzly Bear it would be true love and I would live happily ever afterThe more I come to this park the more I like itIt has every thing you could want for so much fun The other day I was there and they had horses there Doing maneuvers They were Police horses that was so coolIt is a huge place with so much to offerIt has a wave pool and a huge man made pond In there you can fish and boat or just sit and enjoy the waterBathrooms arewell park kind I do not use unless I absolutely have to but at least they have themLots of areas for parties and get togethers I do not know if you have to get a permit for that but you can check their websiteLots of places to park and you can ride bikes all around in there as wellApollos was a fun experience until I checked my bank account and find the erroneously overcharged me over 3500 When I called they tried to tell me it was a debit hold for tip It was not This was a week later and the charge went through They said they would have someone call me back They did not I got the run around and they gave themselves a very generous tip at my expense Have fun but check your bank account they dont play by the rulesI really wanted to like this place Great reviews and a renovated priorywhat a great idea The pictures on the website are beautifulWe found a grumpy old man at the front desk and he could not have been less interested in our arrival It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key But the fun started when we returned later in the evening We found the rollaway we had requested and paid for not present and I went back down to the old gentleman He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer I waited Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling something to the effect that there wasnt anything that he could do and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollawayI slunk away with my guest who had by now come down too embarrassed and insulted It shouldnt be this way If this is personalized service Id rather stay at a motelEven without grumpy old man theres nothing special about this place The rooms were ok but the bathrooms tiny I guess they should be called showerrooms Everything else was subpar The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful We did not dare try the free wine The hotel is in a bad neighborhoodFor the money find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website If you want a boutique hotel try the Inn on the Mexican War Streetsa beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hasslePriory get grumpy old man out of a customerfacing roleI have always wanted to try rock climbing and finally had the opportunity w Stoneman Had an absolutely great time with my instructor Todd He had all the gear  was a great instructor I would highly recommend contacting them if youre interested in getting out there 5 stars all the wayTraveling through Arizona and needed some me time once we stopped at our hotel in Scottsdale I called around found Gel Q and headed over Joe my nail tech was so detail oriented during my entire manipedi He was also very gifted at massage The atmosphere was tranquil and professional and the pedicure chairs had massagers in them that were to die for It was just the relaxing appointment I was hoping for Thank you gel qGreat little neighborhood place Food is good service is great  Try the tofu salad appetizerAbsolutely horrible experience We were seated and drink order was taken by that person Few mins later drinks were dropped off by a different person who said waitress would be over to take our order Then 10 mins later someone came over and asked us if we wanted appetizers which we did and ordered Crab Rangoons and Spare Ribs This person said someone would be back to take our order Never happened The apps came out and the guy said again someone would come take our order So we ate our apps and still no one No one even acknowledged us I had to flag someone down and I said I think our waitress has forgotten about us The man says what you want ummm to order Hes like Yes what you want just staring at us no smile or apology So we ordered and got our food about 10 mins later Had to wait forever for our check I think we had a different server every time someone stopped by The Crab Rangoons were simply not Crab Rangoons There was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever I am not sure what they were but not what I was expecting The Shrimp Fried Rice tasted ok but the Shrimps were full of poo Not deveined and completely packed with poo Just disgusting Wonton soup flavor was good but the actual wontons must have had a teaspoon of ginger in them Strong and not really what I was expecting in a wontonWhole dinner sucked To top it off there was vomit all over the womens bathroom floor No idea why this place was full Many great chinese restaurants around this is not oneDr Randall is a very experienced chiropractor he is very good reading the spine and pointing where the problem is He has physical therapy area massage therapy room and massage therapist by appointment  Dr Randall adjustments helped me to get more balance in my body walking sitting even sleeping  I would definitely recommend Dr RandallOmgeeeee amazing artist  Lucy did airbrush facepaint at my party last week that was waterproof with super cute designs  I cant believe it stayed on when the kids swam in the pool  Im definitely booking them again next yearBest tailor Ive found in the Valley Im very short and very particular about fit  length and he gets it right to a T Hes talented personable and charges a fair priceBTW I dont get all the bad reviews  are we even talking about the same tailorWent for brunch with a group of ladies and we had a great time  The inn is really lovely and its a great if you want to try something new or different for brunchService is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant  The brunch service is basically a four course meal fruit breads entree dessert  And you also have you choice of juices coffee andor teaAll the things we tried were delicious  There were so many things I can barely remember  They also serve Afternoon Tea which Im sure is fabulous So thats definitely next on my listYES so good I go to school about 4560 minutes away and I drove all the way to Champaign for this OK well I went shopping tooCocomero is DIY frozen yogurt and I love that concept There are a ton of different flavors Pick one or mix and match They will also give you taster cups which are really hard to eat yogurt from I dont get it Once you have your yogurt go to the topping bar and choose what you want They have all kinds of fruit nuts and candies I recommend mochi  Then you weigh your creation and pay by the ounce 47oz I believe Sit down or take it to go YUMOld schooltraditional mom n pop quality and perfection The best fish and chips youll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp A great out of the way noncorporate vestige of Americana You will love itThe real deal  If you like your Catholicism quiet and personal with a little organ music and perhaps some donuts after mass then St Marys downtown Phoenix is the parish for youOriginally built in 1881 it is the oldest Catholic Church in Phoenix  Staffed by the Franciscans and located in the heart of Downtown Phoenix  The masses are traditional thoughtful and beautiful  The choir is phenomenal and there is an innate sense of family thereeven as a guestThis place is great  Ive had my daughters take tumbling classes my son do the seasonal sports and all five of my kids have used the swimming facilities  Its affordable safe and diverse enough that we all look forward to trying the different classes  My spouse loves cooking and is excited about the different types of food courses offered  My daughters are interested in learning guitar and piano  My sons may take karate or any number of age appropriate classes  There is a limited day care that I havent used yet but am excited about the potential  The gym is small but has what you need for a pretty good work out  The indoor track is really nice especially in the summer timeI just cant say enough good things about them  I really am glad that its hereI had a backache in my mid back that wasnt going away  I couldnt take full breaths  I had to hunch a little because sitting up or walking straight hurt  My initial thought was that since I practice yoga I can heal myself  I tried downward dog plow pose donurasana spinal twists  I tried hanging upside down and everything   Weve all heard stories about chiropractic  It seems people either love them or hate them  This was my first visit to a chiropractor and I am a fan         Although this guy Danny is new to the Phoenix valley he has been practicing in another state for a while  He seems like he is from the mid west  He is calm and and exudes a casual friendliness     The office was slow or he was ready for me  He led me to a table right away  He took a minute to feel around as we talked about my pain  He said it was obviously T7 based on what I was feeling in my back and it was quite common  He said could skip the Xray if I wanted since I mentioned I was price sensitive    It didnt take long  He adjusted me and then gave a brief massage around the area stretching the muscles around it  He said it was important to adjust the muscles around the problem area because muscles are what holds the bones in place  The massage was great  Danny seems to have a massage background  When I stood up the pain was already gone  As I write this review it has been 4 days and the pain has stayed away  I did 30 miles on my bike today  I am back to normal  What surprises me most is that this Danny at Clarity solved my problem in probably less than 15 minutes and I dont need to go back   I am used to doctors wanting to follow up perpetually for anther 50 visit etcthis guy seems to know he cured me and that was his intention  He seemed to know Id be a one time visit he saved me the Xray expense anyway  That makes it five stars in my book  OleOne of the best Spicy Tuna rolls in town LOVE the hot and Sour soup and they are always so nice in there My fiance is not impressed with the Chinese food on the menu but the rest makes up for it Plus they deliver The food is good but to me the desserts are what really make Latorres special They do this crazy thing with burned sugar that is magicalThey have great lunch specials Its a little pricey for just me but its just right for a business lunch with a client It makes you look smart and sassy and quirky and funTheres lots of vegetarian options which is always a good thing Everything is presented beautifully which is always fun Some of the food seems almost too pretty to eat Salsa night is also a good time The crowd is relaxed and willing to teach a dorky newbie like myself Ive honestly never had a bad time here night or day Charlotte needs more places with so much characterI admit Im fairly new to the serious coffee game but most anyone can tell the good stuff from the badand man does Columbia Street roast some delicious coffee I cant speak to any of the flavored coffees since Ive stuck to their singleorigin and organic fairtrade coffee blends yeah yeahIm one of THOSE people but what Ive had has been absolutely delicious The staff is always friendly and eager to help you find exactly what you needIf youre a regular dont forget to ask for a coffee punch card Buy 10 halfpound or onepound bags and get a bag free Free coffee YES PLEASEOh I almost forgot They have lots of tea as well Immediately to your right when you enter the store I havent sampled any of them but it looked like they have a nice selectionI cant say enough good things about Jim Ludwigs Blumengarten  We hired them to do the flowers for our wedding in April 2012 and the flowers were gorgeous  My bridal bouquet was so beautiful and fragrant that it made me cry  What I especially loved was that Jim and Linda Ludwig personally delivered the flowers to the venue  Jim pinned the boutonniere on my husband and personally handed me my bouquet  Such excellent customer service is rare these days and I highly recommend this businessLove this place They are all very sweet Reasonably priced There is a review below with only one star this place definitely deserves way more than one star VERY Clean facility Will definitely be going backMy heart is broken  The Derby machine has been removed for repairs  They didnt say when it would be back and I have a hunch it is gone for good The last vestige of the Las Vegas that I love is gone   Bobby D was right at the end of Casino Corporations ruined it  the good  ol days  today its all gone  The slot person said it was removed for repairs but I know it was moved because of dollars per square foot or the percentage of the take or the profits per hour or whatever these people use to gouge every last penny of profits  I am sure they are bringing in a digital version insteadThe last known to me derby machine has been sent to storage  This is not about the removal of a game this is about the end of an era  Las Vegas has officially jumped the shark  The last icon of the real Las Vegas is goneas of 12162012in the event they bring this back please postWendy C how can you review a place that youve never been to Im sure the Great Barrier Reef is worth a 5 star review but I cant give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient or any review for that matter Anywaysaw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me I didnt want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy I gave it a shot and I was impressed First the fish to beading ratio was really good Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense probably corn meal based and crumbstyle breaking as opposed to the extra greasy tempura style batter It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 510 minute drive home Tip crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish Served with a lemon The fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning The slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing Purists might say it was over dressed others might say its just right Tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy which was good contrast with the fish The server gladly gave me extra The bun was just as you would expect from a supper club cheap white and doughy Served with a butter chip Everything was served together in a box everything you need except several icy cold beersThe service was fine The take out window was nice It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they frytoorder which is well worth it to me and a big plus Any you cut it it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish FryA little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over 25 for two dinners That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat allyoucaneat Its worth it though and Ill be backAt first I thought Bosa had only in a couple locations in the valley but after we moved to Central PHX Ive realized that Bosa has become a DYNASTYI have always had a passion about donuts Even when I was at my peak health there was room for donutsBosa just does it right the Cinnamon Crumb is clearly the best donut but even the cake donuts rock Please dont make me regret recommending this flavor leave one for me from time to time friendsCoffee is usually quality and black as night The Dunkins in the area seem to have a real problem with consistency but not the case w BosaI too look forward to trying their take on Boba Tea but its gonna be hard to beat The StreetTake it from a guy who could put away a dozen donuts but has the will to eat just one at a sitting Why waste your calories on crappy cakes candies etc Donuts are the way to goI walked in with all the intentions of painting a piece I knew exactly the quote colors and kind of oiece I wanted I just needed help getting it altogether The girl working was so rude and unhelpful She didnt try to help me find a piece and she walked away and went back to cleaning and stocking and then was on the phone with a personal call So I walked out and will never return Such a cute and seemingly fun place but the employees need to be nicer and trained better Such a shameIm a big fan of all the Big Burrito restaurants Ive tried Eleven Umi Mad Mex  Casbah I think Eleven is my favorite but Casbah is a very close second My most recent trip was with my wife on 11510 We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli For entrees I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta For dessert I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream  cookie it was really just a fancy chipwich The grilled flat bread came with three different dips Humus Red Pepper Hummus and Baba Ganoush I really enjoyed all three but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best although if youre not a fan of garlic you may disagree The butternut squash ravioli didnt impress me much but my wife really liked it As far as the entrees we both really enjoyed our meals My pork chop was cooked perfectly and was anything but dry The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor The sides were kale and butternut squash risotto both of which really shined I cant describe how amazing the risotto was and the kale was extremely flavorful I tried my wifes pasta dish and overall I thought it was good but the sausage was really outstanding Incredibly tender and flavorful Neither of us were too impressed with our desserts The creme brulee was very good but at that point I expected it to be great My wifes dessert sort of disappointed since the cookies were dry The bill for everything listed above plus a bottle of red wine 35 was 120 before tip so it is pricey but in my opinion totally worth it Also our server was very attentive and helpful without being intrusive I asked his opinion on the French Malbec and he gave me his honest opinion which was negativeThis place was wonderful all around I would return and I would recommend It is a bit higher price point but it is such a great space it is worth it If you are looking to get away relax have a romantic weekend enjoy nature this is a great place If you just need a place to sleep you might want something less expensive unless you can afford it The first floor of the house is very clean and neat but has a very comfortable and cozy feel There is a small kitchenette stocked with coffee tea cold drinks and lite snacks If we stayed longer I could see relaxing down there enjoying a glass of wine playing a game or reading There is a nice selection of wine available to purchase so you dont even have to go out Our room was very nice King sized bed robes our own deck with a great view of the sheep The bathroom had a big Jacuzzi tub and a large duelhead shower We enjoyed glasses of champagne on the deck before heading out to explore and hike around their land He had dinner downtown Madison which was an easy drive to and from When we returned we were happy to have the fireplace in our room and cozied up with some of freshly baked cookies left out for guests Breakfast was delicious Farm fresh eggs from their hens herbs from the garden and all the other ingredients were local We had good conversation with the other couple staying there as well as the ownersGreat placeThis used to be a great company to work with The products were made well and the service used to be outstanding Now buyer be ware I have had nothing but headaches with my orders First was with the drapery order I placed in July My drapes still are not up because of one debacle after another First some of the hardware didnt arrive then it came in the wrong finish then the didnt include as stated drapery hooks and they are back ordered till Jan 2014 Then hung a pair of drapes and the other pair for another window in the same room wasnt the length stated then I called to have the right length sent Oh sorry mam they have been discontinued you will have to take down the pair you just hung and order something else and by the way it is going to cost you an additional 200 dollars 45 mos later I am still dealing with their screw ups Ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack A friend and I worked on this for 3 hours it should have taken no more than 30 min We could not get it together because it didnt line up Sorry mam you will have to pack up this very large and heavy item and set it out to be picked up Have spent a lot of  and would have had better service and products had I gone to Walmart They used to be a great company I have been brought to tears and all I have gotten is a smug and condescending attitude When I complained to one of the online managers and explained my disappointment with he had no sensitivity to all I have been through and at one point even tried to point the finger back at me At one point told him I would be telling everyone I came in contact with and the internet media how horrible my experience has been his reply  Do what you have to do Wow were has customer service goneWe walked in to the conservatory proper and immediately I felt like I was in Eden A pair of butterflies fluttered by as soon as we entered A wave of humidity hit me and my surroundings all of a sudden became lush and green I was stunned by the birds and butterflies that roamed freely throughout the small conservatory It was an awesome feeling and theres nothing else like it If youre still enough the butterflies will obliviously land on you Theres an area where the butterfly chrysalises hang and if youre lucky youll even see butterflies emerging from their slumberNice place to go climbing For first timers theres a mandatory video  not too bad fairly short As a first timer they were friendly and patient with teaching all the basics Nice staff and nice rocks Good times Free climb on your birthday Good stuffLittle Tokyo is the restaurant where I first experienced sushi so it will always have a spot in my heart  However after gaining a little more knowledge of sushi I still believe Little Tokyo is one of the best  For one I have still not seen daikon rolls on a menu in Ohio and they are one of my favorites  Little Tokyos avocado and kappa rolls are also excellent  My favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu though the others are good as well  The atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a preHomecoming dinner  The service is attentive providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner  They will validate your garage parking for one hour and the mints in a jar at the cash register are deliciousI would highly recommend Little Tokyo especially over Sushi Two or Three I never can remember on Beverly RoadWe went this last weekend bought it through grouponAnd I have to say my family felt like we were imposing on them I called to see if there needed to be reservation and the gal that answered was very short And it almost sounded like she was trying to discourage us to goOnce we arrived we walked into a small lobby and the same gal that answered the phone was the  receptionist and she didnt bother to look up in greeting or greet us Rather she was quite rude and said What she wasnt very anything except rude spoke under her breath and yelled at people So beware of the receptionist with two surface piercing on her collar bone We werent given any direction with anything Just kind of wondered through We had to wait 3 hours for our first lap and they seem to have forgotten our party One of the employee was smoking while working and walked out to help move a go kart that was stuck with his cigarette in hand my dad and my boyfriend didnt have a seat belt well there was straps but no where to click them into No safety enforced no instruction and no customer service Overall it was horrible We paid for three races and a year membership We only did two and the only reason we did the second was we went up and asked why its taking them another 2 hours to get our second race in And when we inquired about the year membership no one knew what that was And no one cared reallyGreat service delicious food and an absolutely stunning view This would be a great place to get marriedRed has some how managed to make every hookah mistake in the book and added a few of their own as well If I could give this place negative stars I woud not hesitate I am astounded at how this place stays in business Red can be found in a decrepit strip mall behind a dunkin donuts next a equally miserable discount movie theater on Tropicana and Pecos They used have a location up in summerlin but moved down there when they couldnt pay the billsTo begin the prices and policies are outrageous Each hookah will average anywhere from 2030 maybe more This is pretty much double the price of most other lounges in town For some reason Red charges additional fees to mix flavors and its not cheap Every additional flavor can tack another 2 bucks to each hookah To accompany this overpriced hookah is of course overpriced drinks And what weird drinks they have Lounges like this that do no aspire to obtain a beer and wine license usually sell an assorments of drinks teas smoothies and the like Red however feels compelled to offer nonalcoholic beers and nonalcoholic wines yes they exisit After seeing their drink selection I wasnt sure if I should laugh or cryNow keep in mind I dont always mind paying more if its worth it but this is definitely not the case at red The hookah is absolutely dreadful I dont think my words could describe the disaster that they bring to your table The hookahs take forever to start and when they do get going they taste like burnt tobacco If your favorite flavors are charcoal and ash this definitely the place for you The biggest culprit behind this atrocious mess is the lounges insistence on using instalight coals They toss these coals on to the bowl and lock it under a metal funnel designed to contain the coal if the hookah falls over On top that they actually demand an extra 5 bucks or so for a relight I was left speechless when I was actually asked to pay another 5 bucks for another coalThe atmosphere and lounge itself does nothing to redeem the hookahs here either You will find CRT television sets displayed proudly around the lounge I dont know why they keep the relics around The place would be actually somewhat attractive if they got rid of them and opened the place up a bit I have never seen it busy or even halfpackedThere are plenty of great lounges in vegas do yourself a favor and stay far far away from this placeYum yum yum LaTorres is one of my favorite lunch spots and Id highly recommend it to anyone who hasnt been  My personal fave is the Pollo Chipotle sandwich with skinny fries  Their food is amazing and the prices arent too bad eitherI have a slight issue with LaTorres and here it is  Once upon a time I asked for the Cubano sandwich but with NO mustard  Well Mr Waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are premade and they are unable to alter them in any way  Hmmpremade hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine  Im a skeptic  After asking around I found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are NOT premade but the managerschefs say that so that they dont get overwhelmed with nitpicky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush  My point  the next time you want your Cubano with no mustard or extra sauce dont believe the hype and make them customize it for you  By the way my spy happens to be an employee so I know its true  All in all this place is greatTook my lova on a date here and we had such a good time  I was impressed and the whole experience was way different from what i anticipated I Bought our tickets online We got there early and were able to wait in a lounge they have open before the main show There is a drink minimum so if you are looking for a cheap date night then i suggest you look elsewhere We loved the atmosphere had good seats service was great also for the place being packed You can order food as well fruit and cheese platter was awesomeSo glad we came here and I will from now on be checking frequently to see who is performing Awesome place if youre looking for a little change  from the normal night out and yes seats are close together but if you dont like people then why are you going to watch one make jokesVery disappointing Too expensive for what you get They were just going through the motions without any emotion Food had no flavor A lot of veggies very little steak or chicken My son and I ordered different chicken but both orders were prepared the same Had to ask for more water Still eating when take home boxes were brought out I felt like I had wasted my hard earned moneySO happy we stopped here Wisconsin cheese wine  beerperfect for dinner We tried about 10 cheeses and fudge they were all so goodThe dark chocolate caramel salted fudge was delicious Glad we stopped here and so will you TIS was definitely my favorite bookstore It always had all my books with used and new options Reserving books online was definitely a time saver It has a year round tshirt deal 3 for 20hello Illinois tshirt obsession I now have over 20 Illinois tshirts Im really serious Sweatshirts are a little pricey here but they tend to cost about the same at the other campus bookstores too  During the book purchasing rush the store has plenty of cashiers so the wait is never too long Writing this review is making me miss TIS and collegeI love this place  The shows can be hit or miss more hits than misses for sure but still worth it  It is a small cozy comfortable place that really cares about being local and celebrating that  They also have lots of fun shows do a FREE Cult Movie Monday each month and have many specials  Check them out for sureEar Wax is THE place to go for buying metal in Madison  They have a huge selection that spans all subgenres definitely with an emphasis on the more extreme subgenres  They also have quite a bit of punk psychobilly and ambient although the focus is really on metal  They also have a good selection of merch shirts patches etc although I found the tshirt selection to be a little skimpy as a person who prefers plain logo Ts as opposed to shirts with tons of art on them  Also most of the shirts are XLEar Wax also has a decent selection of vinyl DVDs and zines although Ive never really checked them out  The focus is really on CDsIf you are a casual metal fan who thinks that Slipknot and Trivium are the best the genre has to offer you will be overwhelmed and possibly intimidated upon walking in  If you arent a metal fan at all you wont find anything of interest unless you want a Cannibal Corpse tshirt for irony purposes  If youre a diehard metal fanatic however this store is right up your alley  Every time I go in there I have a hard time limiting myself to only a few purchases because there is so much that catches my eye  Just about every big metal band is represented along with a whole bunch that Ive never heard ofThe price is right usually around 12 for a CD 7 used and the selection is unbeatable  If you love extreme music you cant pass up the chance to visit this awesome storeServers are chatting not paying attention to tables I can see my salad is ready at the window Worst serves everI went there twice in a week with clients because of its location and the fact that I really like their salads on both days I had to send my food back because there was a hair in it First time on the cheesecake  and the second time in the salad Its a definte must avoid for me nowI hate this placeIts very loud the service is very poor and the food is sosoIf you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh try China Palace Shadyside or Sesame Inn Station Square or North Hills  Theyre quieter with very good food  serviceCame with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip It was very greasy and had virtually no crab The wedge salad was good and crisp I had the hazelnut crusted chicken This has to be one of the worst dishes Ive ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and refreezing all around disappointingDont buy those old premade arrangements from the grocery store or the overpriced stingy bunch of flowers from other places  Come here the service is great and the price is very reasonable  Without realizing it we walked in 5 minutes before closing time  Regardless the owner greeted us warmly and said she would be happy to help us  I told her I didnt know anything about flowers so she asked for a price range and the proceeded to select and arrange a fresh bouquet  Even though it was the end of the day the flowers were still perky and the arrangement was spectacular  Couldnt have been happier and will recommend it to everyone I knowI was very disappointedrude employees pushed service away  I had prepared an anniversary date for my husband and I I had called in asking if I needed to make an appt or reservation and they told me no just come in so we went to dinner first and arrived at this place at 810 they close at 9 and take their last sitting at 815 Their open sign was already off I walked in and no one was at the front you can tell they were cleaning up so I asked if my husband and I could come in and she said no sorry we are closing I was looking at the clock and she said yeah we take our last people at 815 well it was only 810 so we had 5 mins right Nope she was completely rude and made me walk out I was so bummed because our awesome date I had plan was cut short I will be finding another place to go and hope that the owners or managers will find new employees because it is a cute placeWow decent Ballet in Phoenixpinch meI have not been in the last year or so to one of the productions but Ballet Arizona has been a treat under Ib Andersons direction  Im a fan of the classical ballets and have loved their Swan Lake and Giselle productions  This years season is ending so I must repent and make a few shows next yearIf you would  like for someone be disrespectful to you especially when give helpful advice or please attend class here The staff feels they own this non profit and disrespect you with little apologies or consideration They do not even return emails in a dispute They respect depth of your pocket book giving little in return The charges high premium for class so you can learn with famous artist from another state However complain they have no money up date an obsolete system but flying artist from NY Chicago and elect is ok  You dont receive much knowledge or support except you painted with this well know artist Does that not sound like it helping local artist or non profit My favorite part is hiring an education director 2013 without a college education or little knowledge of the arts For as many art education majors out there it is miss directed use of funds not supportive to arts in any way  This school has no courtesy or  loyalty to students  educator been there for years You would expect that for price they ask As a Connoisseur of 5 star establishment gallerys  and assisting in many nonprofits the school fails on all accord But you got to paint with so in so that all you can sayHaving lived in France for two years I found this to be the most authentic food in Phoenix They were very accommodating to special requests The ambiance was beautiful and the restaurant was set in a little pocket of paradise Meaning one might not know that it was so close to 24th St and not see it on a drive byIt is very unfortunate that there is only ONE Colombian restaurant in Las Vegas and this one is not a good example of our gastronomy  What I really dislike about this place is the inconsistency  One day food might be good but the next it will be terrible customer service is very bad and sometimes they dare to serve OLD OLD foodI do love their empanadasthey are pretty goodLas Vegas needs a GOOD Colombian restaurant and not this mediocre placei need you in los angeles boo hoo wah sob appreciate this place pittsburghers it rocksthe cheese is of amazing quality and freshness What fucking varietyAnd there are a million other tasty things under this roof you cant find a place like this easily trust me i have triedDottsy Z and I met here last week to try their new happy hour and we had an amazing time The weather was perfect the patio beautiful and the company was amazingTheir happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines all for 6 plus we tried the escargot pate and frites as well We spoke to chef who was very knowledgeable and able to accommodate gluten free items especially if you call a day or two in advance We topped off the night with a decadent creme brulee and imported cocoa dusted truffles which capped off the evening on a perfect noteThese guys rock I took my whole family on a balloon ride for my Moms birthday We did the sunrise ride mid March The winds were too high on our original day and so we went the next day The team that helped us were very original and you could tell their love of flight They were friendly explained any questions that we had and took us on an excellent balloon adventure A great tradition and toast we had on a beautiful morning The estimated time that was given was spot on for total time to plan for this Thank you for an awesome memoryI REALLY wish we hadnt left The Mint last night  The only thing I did not love was the mint we dropped on drinks but hey its Scottsdale Oh and the boobs in my faceOur bartender AJ  took great care in muddling my Jefferson 5 stars and Sharmans Mint how can you go wrong with a drink named after the establishment while entertaining us with an infused vodka taste test My new favorite drink was discovered last nightginger vodka press run do not walk to your nearest liquor dealerThe tapas were ultra cheap and tasty we took down the tuna tartare and  fried wontons and there are several others I would go back for  These two items were the perfect base for our evening ahead  I want to return for the Bubbles The Gold Digger Eye candy of all ages dress to the nines for this jointI love this place  Its a fun place to sit and relax and sip a glass of vino  Be sure to order the bruschettaI especially love the figs and prosciuttoEXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE Ive used the pharmacy drive through at night and store during the day and both were excellent experiences By accident I left an item behind in the store after a purchase and the employees especially the manager and assistant managers were all VERY helpful in keeping it safe for me until I was able to retrieve itArt is excellent to work with He is very creative and has done several projects for me His prices are fair and the quality is great Art always makes me look good with whatever he producesOk I cant believe its taken me this long to brag about my favorite nail salonIve only been going here for like14 years They are always sweet reasonable CLEAN quick and up to date on all the latest nail colors and trendsI admit I have very high expectations when it comes to service and this place was AMAZING The stylist definitely took the time to listen to my concerns regarding my hair gave me a oil head massage before shampooing my hair a hand massage while my hair was conditioning and an amazing cut all for the low price of 33 I already have plans to make it back Thank you for being so wonderfulThey take great care of you from the start And by the start I mean enquiring about seating by email The hostess is prompt and complete with replies letting me know which nights are fully booked and advising me about better days to come in I came here for lunch since all the dinners were booked up and had the prix fixe 3course lunch Really a steal in my opinionThe waiting staff worked as a great team so we didnt feel ignored even when our server was helping someone else as there were many other friendly staff checking on each others clientele I loved having sweet potato chips at the table to crunch on when we entered and the selection of bread from a wheeled up bread cart with selections such as freshly baked sourdough and olive breadMy starter was the octopus carpaccio which was fabulously laid out and accompanied with colourful pickled vegetables The main was the ox cheek which was so delicate that no knife was necessary Dessert was a chocolate pistachio souffle which was very creative and interesting Not too heavy but nice and warm with a great flavourThe hosts took care of calling our taxi as we exited to proceed with our day after with hunger satisfied and tastebuds delightedBest strip club in Phoenix no contest Went here tonight after writing strip club reviews all day which sparked a debate among my friends  we decided to check it out since none of us had been here before And why the fuck havent we Im pretty picky and Ill just say that every girl in here is good looking and has a good body Even the least attractive girl here would be the best looking girl in most other clubs in town Many of them are downright beautifulCover was 8 bucks there wasnt a drink minimum but drinks were as pricey as any other club and dances were 10 bucks VIP was 20 bucks and wasnt terribly private but it was nice My girlfriend got some good dances and we spent our 80 bucks so quick we had to make another run to the ATM before we had even been there an hour The place has 3 stages and the girls have to rotate to all three which keeps them from being available for awhile and thats kind of a bummer Its nice though because theres always something to look at There are a LOT of girls here too so you wont be sitting there forever waiting for someone to ask you if you want a dance I was told that the management here was great too and most of the girls I talked to had worked at other clubs but found this one to be the best by far This place is a little more laid back than other clubs the girls dont go crazy with the pole dancing  guess when youre hot you dont have to At first I thought they were just looking bored but when they come around to chat they light up This place is more about mingling than watching a showBourbon Street blows the doors off pretty much every club in town and even ones in Vegas If you have the urge for flesh or out of town guests and just want a mellow time with some beautiful girls putting boobs in your face definitely go hereJen Reid is an awesome stylist  She does such a great job with my color and is the browwhispererOur company has used Brenda at Embroidme for several items We couldnt be happier with her prices and her service Thanks EmbroidmeTheir Friday fishfry is to die for stick with the traditional cod No wonder theyve been voted as the Madisons 1 fishfry favorites year after year Call ahead and make a reservation if you are planning to go for the Friday affair The place is literally packed My friend and I got lucky and was seated at the nice booth seat right next to the bar While waiting for our food to come we got to watch locals enjoying themselves at the bar My bloody marry was a perfect accompaniment to the cod I think my friend enjoyed his martini and perch as well  The food is excellent the service is excellent and its got the homey atmosphere  I have nothing to complain about this placeThe best black sesame ice cream ever I had a scoop there and wanted a pint to go Unfortunately there was only enough for one more scoop So I took itSTAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE They have nurses on drugs walking around in a zombi like state nurses that have been in drug rehab several times an handing out patient meds This place is run badVery disappointed in the customer service attitude of the staff Stopped in to have drinks with friends and the bar area was very cold We were informed the Htg wasnt working but it was fine in the dining room  We tried to open the door between but was rudely informed by the chef we could not do so Im a long term customer and that attitude was never part of the Avenue Bar  And what chef dictates who gets to be warm or coldBeware of this gym I put my membership on hold because of an injury and they said I still owe them money I finally said OK and went into pay and canceled my account I received an email for another bill that was still owe They told me I didnt sign something I said the employee never ask me to sign something Oh well they are very unwilling to work with someone and are very RUDE I will tell as many people as I know to never use Lifetime because there service lacks any kind of common senseI manage an Urgent Care down the street and refer patients to this office frequently Especially the new patients in town that have had the same doctor where they came from for 15 years and are looking for a new well rounded practice and knowledgeable team of doctors that they can trust  I call to get feedback from them about their experience just like I do when I refer patients to a certain Orthopedic Urologist ENT Imaging Center ect  and all the responses I get are all pleasant  They like the idea of having xray and lab services on site unlike most PCP offices in the valley that have to send their patients to a different location to receive those services I have not been there myself so I cant give you a personal account but from the feedback that I get I never have any reservation in recommending Dr Wyse and his team of doctors and staff to any patient looking for a new PCP that doesnt treat you like a number and takes hisher time to address all your concernsExcellent little place Typical french I ordered the beef bourguignon which is a first  It was delicious and well worth it  Desert try the creme bolle yummyThe service was also excellent the atmosphere intimate I would definitely go there againMaybe I am just the most jaded vegan in town Quiet Storms food menu bores me to tears that which I will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home Their coffee isnt all that great either as given the choice local La Prima is in my favor Tears This is the only vegetarian restaurant on the East side of town and oh so close to me but I cannot stand to go there Desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining roomYou like your meat long smoked and spicy They got that Short and thick  with an au naturel casing They got that too Thin floppy and tasting of meatloaf Hey whatever gets your rocks off The snausages here are crazy amazing and they have just about any pork related product your little heart can dream up ground to an appetizing taste and texture with just the right amount of spice The prices are also more than fair compared to other meat markets around town Word to the wise Schreiners is a small mom and pop and they only take cash check crazy right or debit cards No credit will be extended to your broke ass And if you want to use your debit card you have to gather up at least ten bucks worth of meat in your hot little paws before theyll run the card Dont worry its more than easy to do The people that work here are very knowledgeable and if you tell them what you like and why theyll recommend all sorts of stuff They have an intimate knowledge of the meat they sling So stop on buy shoot the shit and theyll slip you some mighty fine sausageWe hired Fancy Faces for the kids at our company picnic  It was fabulous   We will have her back for all our future events entertainment  A good time had by allNever again worst experience ever very ghetto and in professional we paid for bottle service and once our bottle was done we was booted from our table  was told someone else had just brought the table smh but no other table got extra bottles are were forced to move from their table  then I got outside and s guy is in my car searching  how did he get in who know where was security  never again ppl make this ur last result  this place needs some improvement on services for sure  more ac  and air freshener the club has a  funny smell to itI went to a yelp event here where we were able to make a fused glass piece and also watch some demonstrations and go to the gallery Everything in the gallery was amazing The demonstrations were neat and the fused glass was something I would go back to do againI really didnt know that the glass center was open most of the time and if you go there on any random day you can watch whatever is going on I think that is pretty cool They also have classes where you can blow glass or make beads or whatever you want I cant wait to pick up my piece and come back for another classUgh I hate this place  People from work drag me here to lunch more often than I would like  The food is overpriced  The service is snotty and slow  I can barely get free in under an hourandahalf  The food is forgettable and the menu sparse  Theyre terrible for pickup too  even when you call way ahead youre made to wait and theyre surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food  You can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere  Try SoHo or Finnegans insteadThe MWC is definitely an oasis in our busy lives Check out their schedule and attend one of their programs for an overall good feelingI walked into Penn Macaroni Co knowing I knew absolutely nothing about cured meats and cheeses  Ive always been intimidated by specialty shops bc there are always giant lines with people who look impatient and want to just grab what they need and head out  I decided to swallow up my fear and head inside with the intention of walking out knowing more than when I walked inI headed to the cured meats section in the deli room and kinda just stood back staring at all the beautiful meats  When one of the deli guys was free and asked me if I needed help I flat out told him I know nothing about anything in this room  But I want to learn  And he was like I got just what you need and brought out some samples for me  He went on to explain them to me and what kind of cheeses to pair with stuff  After I picked out my meat I was heading over to the cheese counter when he kinda called me out and was like Im not done with you yet and handed me butcher paper with even more cured meats and cheeses to try out  He also told me I have to feed my friend more bc she looked too skinny PI love going into a store where I get individualized attention by someone who actually cares about what he or she is doing and is passionate about his or her job  It just makes you walk out with a smile on your faceI plan on heading back every other week to get a new pairing of meats and cheeses and hopefully one day my palate will be super sophisticated hahaAll that jazzOther places do jazz once in a while But these folks do it all year round Aw yea Great venue and friendly bar staff Dont know much about the food but their drinks and desserts are solid But really you come for the jazzTips Check out the website for the latest performance information and singermusician biographyDefinitely deserves the title  Artistic professional fast and punctual It pains me every time I have to wash it off Shes amazingThe German Sausage company is the closest thing we have to a big city charcuterie in Phoenix  Our family has been enjoying their homemade ham lyoner bratwurst and smoked meats for 30 years  Their prices are so much more reasonable than the grocery store deli counters and their products are always very fresh  Walking through the door will immediately transport you to Europe  Dont miss this Valley gem   cash or check only just like the olden daysOh man AZ Donut Co is the best worst thing to ever happen to me These donuts are by far some of the best in the valley especially when you get them fresh and theyre right down the street from my house so well Im a regular now and I eat far too many donutsMcMullans is awesome I really like everything about this place The staff is very friendly The food is great The Beer selection is good with alot of imports as well as my favorite Miller Lite They make fun of me for ordering Miller Lite in an Irish pub but I get a Guinness from time to timeto mix it up  Tuesday night pub trivia is alot of fun This is my favorite Irish pub in town plus I can avoid the whole strip to get to it Too many pubs are in the hotelsMcMullans is a much better optionExtremely terrible The only good about this place is the decor The food was horrible the chicken was rubbery the veggies were a joke My wife and I only ate the fried rice paid our bill and then went to Sushi Mon Dont go here you will be very disappointedThe Desert Botanical Gardens are an oasis in the local sea of strip malls and desert  Many and varied plant areas including an oasis and desert  Summer evening flashlight tours are worth the price of membership1475 for one well rum  coke not including tipI dont freaking think so ever again plus I had to send my boyfriend to get me my drink since NO ONE ever came to our table ever Oh wait I take that back the cocktail server did stop by to say where closing nowHorrible lash techDoesnt  know what she was doing Didnt have me sign a liability waiverWhich as a certified lash technician it is against the law to put chemicals near peoples eyes without first signing a liability waiver  Eyes were puffy and red the next day she added for lashes to a single lash which if youve ever had your lashes done you know thats very painful I called her and complained she told me to come in the next day that she would give me my money back when I came in the next day she was not there and is now refusing to give me my money backDo not use her for lashesTHIS PLACE IS OPENThe best food and the best service Try the butter nut squash ravioli  FantasticWhat a cool place I have NO green thumb WHATSOEVER but had passed by for about a year now since I moved to Dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute Now was my chance as I needed a last minute Christmas present for my grandma The place is larger than you think from the outside They actually have a whole outdoor area thats covered for the winter with many different plants I couldnt identify I thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic Her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase not in a pot and looked really cool and modern I loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself if I wouldnt kill it which I probably would I had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art They turned out to be flower displays for hotels but man where they cool If I was doing an event or having a wedding thats exactly what I would have wanted They just looked really modern but creative They also have some winged friends you can say hi to including one screaming one in the back that you cant see Kinda creepy but I guess that comes with a unique shop I will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events I have coming upIts like most family fun places but seems to have a lot more It had miniature golf batting cages go karts bumper boats arcade games and sandbeach volleyball and a driving range The best part The automatic tees that come up with your ball and the fact the balls load themselves No more carrying around a bucket for the truly lazy  Overall it seemed pretty clean as well  I didnt eat there so I cant say much on the foodI have been here twice both times with a large group  we had a private room  Service was excellent as was the food  I always recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte  they always tell me how much they loved itI now understand where the name comes from Yesterday I went into Dicks to buy my daughter some shirts As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package It said things like  missing manual or dead battery I found a watch that was missing a manual I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for I purchased the watch as is and took it home After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones I got annoyed I went back to the counter to find a different manager I was told that Nicole is it I waited some more After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in   i pointed out that as people look through the bag   watches are being mixed up I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps After going through each bag I could not find the correct band Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference Nicole said no I get as is but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and dateNow I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price Thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watchPissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer DadAwful service took us 2 and a half hours to get our food and the waiter forgot several items then added a few beers we didnt order on to our tab Im assuming because he thought we were too drunk to notice Then we find out that after we had nicely split the tab for them even adding in an extra 10 on top of the grat because we were too lazy to redo the math that they wouldnt split the check In the time we argued about it you could have run the 3 credit cards we had and been done with itHad to argue with the manager who was completely unhelpful with one of the waiters standing behind her and being rude to me for backup for 10 minutes and they didnt give us an inch I would have stiffed the waiter for the awful service if I could have but we got gratted so I didnt even have that optionIf you want to come here with more than 3 people avoid Ds Their beer is severely overpriced 10 for a beer I can get at Sharp Edge for 6 no thanks and the food is the same fried garbage covered in cheese you can get at any other bar in PittsburghIn other words dont come here I used to like this place but tonight was such a bad experience Ill just go to one of the other places in Pittsburgh that serves hot dogs french fries and beer There are plenty of them I wont miss Ds at allThis is my favorite place for Friday fish fry I cant find a better place in MadisonI love it  Love itSt load of fun Just remember to not drink too much the night beforeYou must go see the NCDT I just saw the fall show limitless and it was incredible I have enjoyed NCDT for years but this performance was on a whole new levelRelaxing well thought out greenspace Various different areas each with its own character You can be busy with other people or find a secluded shelter for some peace and quiet watch out for the kamikaze squirrels though Wonderful glasshouse but with an entry fee Cafe a bit expensive so bring a lunchSome nice events take place here so watch out for thoseHad an amazing trip with these guys  Total pros who love what they do and it shows  Highly recommendjust returned from a three day weekend at the inn with 12 sorority sisters from around the country  It is understandable why the inn gets such rave reviews  From the extraordinary service of the staff which was both accommodating AND anticipating to the beautifully furnished and outfitted rooms  I stayed in the Braeburn on the first floor which was large comfortable and filled with light to the delicious breakfasts it was an outstanding experience all around  I am thrilled to spread the word and recommend your inn without reservationMy oh My If youre in Las Vegas and love cross stitch do NOT miss this shop The front of the shop has got the more current chartslittle kitsseasonal charts so you have to run the gauntlet of great stuff before you can even greet the shop owner Check out the beautiful models most stitched by the owners business partner But duck into the side room and take in the fabulous selection of fabrics This is a stashbuilder store for sure The owner was knowledgeable and patient Note that this shop is NOT the internet shop with the same name but brick and mortar only though phone orders and shipping are offeredMy parents were visiting from Oregon and since their birthdays were upcoming I bought them a sunrise ride over phoenixThey came back from their trip overjoyed They said it was an amazing experience and that their pilot was absolutely great They surely recommend this company and its toursthank you guysI only got to this place once while I was in Arizona and really intended to go backmaybe next trip  They had really wonderful spaghetti with white clam sauce an item I often try but rarely find as good as my home place in CaliforniaSan Fillipos in La Mesa  My daughter got the calzones which she had had here before and knew they were good  I had a taste and while that is an item I never order they were delicious  The atmosphere here was very nice also and I was really glad we had chosen it  Its one I wouldnt hesitate to recommend to othersDiscover your innerracer here You get to suit up optional and wear a neckbrace and helmet a mustdo and cause all kinds of havoc on this track although bumping is not allowed Bumping is for lessskilled drivers anyhow youre just here to race and test your skills against competition and that just adds to the fun Youre timed all the way down to your fastest and slowest laps and given a standings sheet after each race It can be a bit tiring toward the end but it is a good workout and youll wanna experience the adrenaline rush again It was in all honestythe best time I had in VegasFirst time in Pittsburgh a great valueFree shuttle tofrom the airport tofrom downtown area and they will drop you offpick you up wherever within a reasonable distance The staff is EXTREMELY friendly The bed was comfortable and the room was clean It was a little small but it was comfortable Only stayed for one night but wouldnt have minded staying for moreOh yeah complimentary breakfast which I didnt wake up for happy hour which I wasnt in the hotel for and indoor heated pool which I didnt get to go inps tip the shuttle driver peopleFor the barWhile looking for places to have Easter brunch I saw the Sunnyledge appear several times in my searching They no longer do easter brunch but they do have their martini bar  which many people seem to rave about I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday eveningJust getting off work I came alone The location is a historical landmark a mansion built in 1889 and is the reason they deserve their single star The mansion from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass The furniture is elegant but not stuffy and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted The bar is rather small housing four 2seat tables a 4top and about 8 spaces at the bar Behind the bar light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughoutI browsed the martini menu not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter or too far from a martinitequila cointreau and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini  and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesnt send a good impression of your margarita I stuck with the classic then and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish It was made quickly and without love shaking instead of stirring and putting it in an unchilled glass Not that there was much to love while the bottles on the shelf could be called midrange the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel Bankers Club is the gin of choice here and Burnetts flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu The martini cameNot filled to the top seems they measure precisely to include garnish strong with little vermouth but given the alcohol devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrusI found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant even though signage was still in place throughout the building I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab How much did my room temperature Bankers Club cost A cool 9It appears that somewhere between the last two years and now this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink hop a cab to Walnut street At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drinkThis is the first time Ive been here  First of all the Singapore Noodles was the best I have ever tasted in my life and Ive had several  The waitress was great  The bus boy literally came around every 5 minutes to make sure everyone had water and he took the dirty dishes away right away  I dont mind saying I may eat here again tomorrowCame here for AZ Spa Week and it was a great experience I got a 50 Stress Melting Treatment Normally 230John was my treatment specialist and was super personable and sweet The changing room is a bit smalltight if there are multiple gals changing at the same time But otherwise the whole spa is CLEANI would go here more often if I could afford itWhen I lived in northern Illinois and made occasional day trips to Madison Ear Wax is a store that I always made time to stop in  Not only do they have a great selection of music but the store owner is knowledgeable and friendly  Hes the kind of guy who deserves your business  Also they have a great sticker selection  What punk rocker doesnt like to put a few on his or her carTwo cheers for Geos Chicken Strips Im

SelfDefense and character building  Youll also have a great time as part of the Professional Karate Center FamilyOne of my all time favorite restaurants in Pgh Casbah is still going strong 15 years later Todays lunch was a wonderful mac and cheese with braised lamb my dining companion enjoyed the corn risotto with shitake mushrooms and a side heirloom tomato salad They use the best fresh local ingredients to craft some of the most delectable interesting fresh food around  Also great for Sunday brunch  You wont be disappointedI was really excited the day after new years to get a bagel with my best friends I traveled all the way from Milwaukee to see Upon arrival the place was pretty busy with people who obviously frequented the establishment often We dont have many Brueggers in Wisconsin so it was my first time here and it was not an enjoyable experience to say the leastIt began by me placing my order and asking for my sandwich without the tomato spread The worker actually interrupted me mid sentence to ask which bagel I politely stated my preference and moved along The older gentlemen working the cash register asked what we got I said what bagel and my boyfriend also asked for 2 hazelnut coffees The cashier responded with K I asked okay and he responds with I need to know what size I shrugged it off and was like well whatever maybe hes bummed to be working on new yearsThen when I get my bagel it has the tomato spread on it which I politely asked for it without yet was interrupted The man literally says Maam I dont know what you actually ordered and TOMATO is different than TOMATO SPREAD Like Im sorry WHAT the sandwich comes with only one kind of tomato pretty sure thats impossible to get confused with I tried so hard to not say a big screw you too He made a huge deal about the whole thing and if he wasnt so rude when we were paying I probably wouldve shrugged it off I had too much pride thoughTHEN he comes up to me and says MAAM just so you know you were over charged because you ordered incorrectly You shouldnt do that next time K Maybe if you took the time for decent customer service and realize we obviously have never been to a BrueggersAnd to put this into perspective I worked at a breakfast place last year on new years day and not once did I feel the need to be that rude to anyone It sucks but its not my faultLove this place And everyone needs to gt the okra It is amazing and super easy to fry I dont know who of my group picked this place out but they never owned up to it The service was absolutely terrible  The waitress was practically all but ignoring us  We only got offered one round of drinks never asked if we wanted a second round  We had to ask for our silverwarenapkins after our food came and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly when they asked her to get something she would immediately come back to their table not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return Aside from just being terrible she was also unfriendly  As for the food all my friends seemed to enjoyappreciate their meals  For about 810 you get a huge sandwichburger and a side of fries  Except 8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to meAs a vegetarian it was entirely another matter for me  Not wanting a veggie burger I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip  potato wedgeschips  vegetables off the appetizer menu  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well she said yeah it should come with it as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says  It wasnt actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she offered to get them for me  She disappears Ten minutes later my friends halfway through their meal no vegetables in sight but at least we have silverware and napkins now  Five minutes later she hears us loudly complaining and says shes told the kitchen twice now yeah right Another ten minutes later were complaining real loud now to ourselves because no staff member is in sight  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semiwarm at best He returns and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about THREE 6inch cuts of celery and TWO 4inch by 1inch hunks of a carrot completely RAW  It took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation  We immediately asked for a box and a discount Yes he discounted us 10 of our final bill which I think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips plus half of my beer  The waitress brought it out as one check too not asking if us 2 men and 2 women obviously 2 couples would have wanted the check splitThe kicker the sidewalk sign outside their door read Charlottes Finest  Methinks notI love Hillbilly Market and come here for my local produce and meats I love supporting local agriculture even if it is a couple more bucks The prices are great I love getting their green tomatoes and grapefruits The grapefruits are the best Ive found in the area This is the only place I have found green tomatoes for sale They also have a great selection of local meats including great affordable country ham I will continue to shop here for my various random wants and needs I cant wait to check out their summer selection of produce and plantsBest bubble tea in Madison Above average compared to other places with more bubble tea shopsI was excited to see that a champagne lounge would be the newest addition to Market Squares continuing revitalization Champagne on tap Who knew Unfortunately Perle falls flat on its face in almost every regard The decor is well trashy Its all black upholstered couches and recessed multicolored LED lights a la frat boy with an interior design budget I was unaware that the prevailing aesthetic of the CENTER of downtown Pittsburgh is trending towards Bridge and Tunnel coke den Come on Perle were better than that Perle also seems to think that its possible to cram a nightclub restaurant and lounge into the same relatively small space It doesnt work They should have stopped with the menu and fancy drinks and not continued to the obnoxiously loud music emanating I kid you not from a kid with a MacBook and an accompanying saxophonist playing what can only be described as 1991inspired acid jazz Gross Finally there was an entourage of what looked to be the ownermanager the night I visited making it feel like the place is an extension of someones living room and not in a good way in a clubby way Of course I realize that my opinion may be in the minority as there are likely throngs of Cranberrians and Wexfordites who will be thrilled at the prospect of a real night out in tahn Knock yourselves out Ill happily be steering well clearOnce you to to all grain brewing this is the store where you need to go as they have a walk in grain room and you can taste the grain you are using in your allgrain brewing In addition the staff is extremely courteous and helpful Ive received some great tips from them on improving my brewing Just a first class operationI went in for a simple everyday ordinary haircut TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE thats 27300 later I came home with products I just

the spot in front of other customers so as to embarrass you and trick you into buying something you really dont need just to boost their commission sales Jennifer hasnt the foggiest notion how to properly complete a mans haircut She neglected to trim the sideburns ear nose eyebrow and neck hair even though I asked her to which she responded We have people who do that for an extra charge and suggested I spend more money to have another girl wax these areas WTF Are you kidding me here REALLY On the lighter note I am getting a socalled complimentary facial Definitely a place where you should prepare yourself to be accosted by staff to spend more moneyI have no idea how to dress my husband and neither does he so I went here asking for help Dakota the salesmen who helped me is such a pro Friendly knowledgable and put together several options He should style for mens magazines Thank you DakotaOn a glorious day in the month of May  my love and I stumbled hungrily into rock bottom  Ha Just kidding I realized Darren W Hadnt reviewed here so I had to start it cheesy  The rock bottom line Monday for lunch we had awesome service by Ashley  We werent rushed and it was quite  The burgers were great and half off  The beer was very good  We will be returning for sureOne of my favorite places and they have thee Best Lemon Drop Martinis Plus the Bar Tender looks like Clark KentSuperman very handsome guyUpdateI find it absolutely amazing that a person can pass away at their facility  then one day short of 7 weeks later someone from that facility is calling for the deceased asking to speak with them regarding paperwork that needs to be completed Thats definitely a textbook procedure of making sure the family of the deceased isnt reminded of the passing  Also just goes to show how uninvolved the clinicalnursing staff was with my dads brief stay and passing at this facility Seeing as no one from that facility gave me nor my family any attention  that they would miss that someone actually passed away or who it was Id save a copy of the voice mail and send it to the facility administrators or the risk management team  however with the attitudes and behavior I witnessed from their staff there that night  and now with the voice mail I just listened to  Im sure they wouldnt careIm moving on and putting this all behind me after this review Id suggest that you just keep moving on if you ever find this place as an option for care  for yourself anyone you know or love and even your enemies5 stars for the drunk females and 1 star for the place being so small lol p Its 21 and over on the second floor and below its 18 they dont serve alcohol at the bottomThe fact that a self serve yogurt bar doesnt allow you to sample any of the 16 flavors they have blows my mind Being from out of town and having plenty of similar establishments near my home that are same concept and allow samples I was confused When I asked the counter you would rather have me not buy anything than sample 2 flavors  Responseyes Unreal plenty of places are successful and lucrative with allowing a taste test My only thought is the ownermanager must be cheaper than subsidized corn  Fellow friends said their yogurt was bland probably why they stopped allowing samplesUgh I got a plate with seisage tofu scramble and sundried tomato toast My whole plate was entirely dry chewy and unpalatable I had high hopes for the tofu scramble especially after seeing positive reviews about it But honestly It tasted like nothing I thought itd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu but it was hard dry and chewy Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy Anything will taste better drenched in gravy We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water On top of all this service wasnt the greatest I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didnt even bother to ask me what kind of toast 3 options on the menuI wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal Then they didnt bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the 12 entrees that come with coffee or juice We had to tell someone else to get it for us Also they dont really wash their cups There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty Good idea but poorly executed food Ive had good vegan and vegetarian food before thats consisted of a lot of fresh greens avocados and more For a vegetarian place there was nothing green on our plates This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations Couldve eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same priceAmong the best of the burgh  Great live acts on a regular basisPamela is a bad representation of this location Attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this employee I will not returnI love this place The machines are fun and the coin aspect is a nice perk The cocktail server is AWESOME They are super quick and attentive I always tip them well You should too You wont regret itMan oh man Youve got game if you shop here If I were a guy I would buy my entire wardrobe from Stitched A combination of classic and contemporary suiting and street  this is how a man with swag dressesThe store itself is the ultimate man cave Theres a billiard table in the back flat screen tvs on ESPN and even a whisky lounge with Macallan scotch lockers to rent There are also several cool choppers worked into the decor Theres an onsite tailor stitching up sharp suits too personalized with your name if youd like Probably the only thing missing is a cigar bar and hot female cocktail serversPrice points are really reasonable A lot of the coats and blazers that I liked were around 250 Youll find ready to wear brands like George Esquivel Jacks  Jokers Rag  Bone Cr8tive Recreation Louis Stewart and Psycho BunnyAnd girls the sharp looking men that work here make the visit worthwhile tooWOWwas all i can sayIts only water spraying out but if u really get into it its very touching and romantic  The music water the bellagiospeechlessI having been going to Su to have my nail tips done for 14 years  I have never had a nail lift or ever had a fungus  There have been times I have not been able to get back for a month and still no problem  I also have pedicures by Eileen and they last just as long The establishment is always clean and the staff is very friendly  I give the highest rating possible and advise everyone to give them a chanceMy first  last order I had Mandys Special 3 fish  3 shrimp fried mushrooms clam strips coleslaw  potato salad The clam strips were good portion size was tiny mushrooms were nicely breaded  picture perfect looking but mushy inside  tasted like the frying oil was used over  over to cook both clams  shrimp The shrimp actually had an oily taste  mouth feel My coleslaw had actual 14 inch slices of carrots  onions while the potato salad was all mush along with the ff I got the cod fish After I finished blotting the oil from the pieces  reheated them it wasnt bad I just couldnt understand why I was in the kitchen cooking when I had ordered out For the money I certainly expected better Sadly I really love seafoodusuallyVery nice place Mohsen knows how to cut my hair  which not an easy job Comparable to the high end places my wife and would go to in LA and Santa Barbara Great to have this level of skill in CharlotteI will never go to this place again and I recommend the many otherclubs for anyone looking for a good time while in Vegas I was charged double the posted rate for a dance by a dancer namedCya When I brought the overcharging to a managers attentioninstead of refunding my money they gave me entry passes to the club  Ihope Cya gets fired for being fraudulent and lying to management about what shecharges customers  Dances are 20 per song I was charged 40 per song for topless onlyAgain I will not be returning to this club as longas Cya is employed there and I suggest everyone do the same  Saveyour money and go to a better clubAngus is an excellent instructor  Hes very patient and obviously knowledgeable about what he teaches  Besides techniques he also has a vast store of knowledge based on experience that makes his classes truly comprehensive and applicable to the real world  And on top of all that hes a great guy who makes training funFOUR STARS Are you fucking kidding me Come on Vegas step your dim sum game up Three words to describe the waitressesLOUD RUDE OBNOXIOUS Food is mediocre Id say below average compared to 626 SD or even Irvine So if youve had any of the above this place will DISAPPOINT  and definitely annoy the shit out of you The heat alone made me 289347x irritable than usual so imagine that plus the waitresses incompetencyI had to stop a group of Asians in the middle of a cross walk because I saw BOBA in their hands The people who works here were mad friendly and they gave me a great suggestions Probably the best in Wisconsin I would sayMy two sisters and I wanted to take our Mom and Dad on a hot air balloon ride for their anniversary and my Dads birthday We had emailed a few of the well known companies in the area and Matt at Float got back to us first We were glad to hear they had a balloon to fit us 5 plus the pilot as we wanted it to be a more personal experience Our pilot Peggy was fantastic as was her crew help PatWe all agreed it was a great experience but the most notable part came when we arrived back home and my mom realized she lost three 100 bills from her pocket she had similarly lost lottery tickets from her jacket the day before I emailed Matt to see if he could check the back of the van and he responded immediately that he would have Pat check Sure enough the money was in the back of the van and he called me back to let me know and to properly get it back to usSuch an honest and classy thing to do and my mom was so relieved albeit embarrassed Overall it was a really nice experience and in good company Wed definitely recommendI ordered take out from this PF Changs on Tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible Not only I was the food ready 45min later than the time frame they gave me over the phone the food was soggy underprepard and bland For example the Kung Pao Shrimp was not fried as it is supposed to be and doughy My family always orders this dish in various locations and this was by far the worst Delay and food preparations aside what really sets me off is that I not only waited 45 min to receive my food altogether the preparation time was well over 60min I have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude Maybe I am spoiled but in every PF Changs I have been so far I have received a credit on the bill or a voucher if something is off This time I have received nothing only a half hearted apology of the manager in my opinion if a customer waits 45min in the restaurant for a 110 pickup order made on the phone prepays AND still gives 5 tip I expect to get something off the bill Here however I have received nothingI will not visit this restaurant anymore and cannot recommend it Sadly it has lost its game  maybe it was the Tusday managerSir Eds Have to say I was there the first night they opened their doors and have been returning ever since It has the best of many worlds go early enough it is a great Restaurant with a different menu than what you would expect You have to try the Ostrich Meatloaf Go a little later in the evening it is the classic pub I enjoy them both I have been to restaurants and pubs all over Europe and the USA  Sir Eds ranks right up there with the best of themIt is a great place to go for a celebration or just to grab a beer in the evening Draft selection is great a true bonus if you like English beer and Guinness I have always found the staff to be outstandingOver the years they have had a couple that were not up to the task but thankfully they did not last Bar Staff is always wonderful and accommodating and over the years have become friends Great place to goA great indoor place to bring the kids for something fun to do  Highly recommendOk so this lady is seriously talentedSeriouslyLike artist talented  These arent your typical run of the mill face paintingsIll attach a few pics of the work she did on my hand and my boyfriends face he wanted a painting to look like he fell into a cactusI likeMost people will try to tell you that Zia Records is the best record store in the valley Those people would be correctWhy the low score then Because being Crown Prince of the Turd Playground that is Phoenixs record store selection is not exactly a glowing accomplishment This store does several things wrongFor one this location in particular pesters the shite out of you Are you finding everything alright Are you finding everything alright YES Jesus Christ I was finding everything alright the first four times you asked me now be a good little retail monkey and leave me the bloody hell alone so I can shop and eventually give you my moneyIm sure its this economy business thats to blame and not necessarily corporate nonsense but someone needs to take their manager out back and explain that annoying the piss out of your customers may actually be worse than ignoring them And its just this store I went to the TBird location and wasnt bothered Someone casually asked me if there was anything I needed and I said No and was done with it But at this store I was literally asked three separate times by the SAME IDIOT if I was finding everything okayPerhaps it was the annoying tunes they had playing that added to the grating atmosphere Censored Rap Not that Im a fan but hearing the song go silent every five seconds to omit a blatant swear is fairly tiresome after awhile 70s Funk and bad Butt Rock seem to be on the menu ad nauseum Though in fairness perhaps its just the staff during the morning or something I notice at night it gets a bit better if you can crawl out from beneath all the employees asking you if youre doing okay long enough to even noticeIve never gathered the courage to stand in the line of leering meth addicts at the Trade Counter to tell you whether they give decent store credit for used stuff though so Ill leave it to greater minds to judge that facet of their business model I will say that their used stuff is in good enough shape if you dont count the bleeding stickers they put on absolutely everything You inevitably spend twice the time you would have spent actually listening to your purchase doing nothing but peeling tape and stickers Theyre worse than Gamestop that way I payed for it its mine Why are you putting your ugly stickers all over my albumBad neighbourhood tooI hate to sound so negative without balancing out with some positive but the experience is fairly fresh in my mind as I just went earlier today I guess their prices are good unless you want something newish In which case bending over and having plenty of lube handy is the best advice I can offerJust know what you want Go in Get out And for gods sake avoid their overzealous employees as if they were landminesOr just give the constant irritants a pass and go to a different location Or Bookmans I know I willi need you in los angeles boo hoo wah sob appreciate this place pittsburghers it rocksthe cheese is of amazing quality and freshness What fucking varietyAnd there are a million other tasty things under this roof you cant find a place like this easily trust me i have triedSo I have eaten here a hand full of times and the food and service has always been out of this world This is actually one of my favorite places to get fillet Mignon Although I have tried many other things on the menu though like the wild boar  which will blow your mind Regardless I think you would be hard pressed to find bad food here The only disappointment I have ever experienced with this place is that they serve Foie Gras I am sure they make what is considered good foie gras but I just think it is cruel in terms of what they have to do to the poor duckgoose to make this dish As far as the feel of the place although it is upscale I find it to be a bit more casual than formal With low light and deep tranquil colors it is relaxing setting a good stage for conversation Another great date place in my bookBefore I went to Vegas this past weekend a pedicure was a necessity I decided to check out Magen Nail in Tempe since its close to where I live and they were open until 7 pm on Friday You can either make an appointment or just walkinI made an appointment but it wasnt necessary The interior is very simple and clean which is fine with me since I didntt need anything fancy The staff is very friendly and the technician who gave me my pedicure was very sweet We chatted the whole time in fact She did a great job especially with the salt scrub and calf massage work that day had been stressful and busy so I was in desperate need of relaxation My pedicure was 19 and the salt scrub was an extra 5 but was totally worth it to me A great experience and I will definitely return in the future for manicures and pedicuresok i dont want to judge all atrias by this one in fact i wouldnt even judge this atrias solely by this one experience but let me tell you i was highly disappointedi will point out the good parts of the night first we arrived to see a band play the entertainment was great didnt cost extra although there was a 20 minimum per person and i liked the set up in the room where they played also the soup i got crab bisque was deliciousok now for the rest of the experience first of all our service was AWFUL i dont know our servers name and i know some of the wait wasnt his fault as there was a large party upstairs but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks another 15 before we even got them ten more minutes before we could order our food and after the meal we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain i saw him checking on other tables and it didnt seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy as a server myself i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt but it really got to be too much the one thing i will say for him though was that he was very nice but for how much we waited we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology BEFORE we had to complainthe rest of the food and drinks were okay good but not enough to make up for the service i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eatid try another atrias before id go back to this one but now im weary of the restaurant all togetherI feel as though I needed to write this review This is just tragic that such a prime  location on the lake has terrible food service and if that isnt enough even their drinks are so solive in town and never been happy with the food Only up is the location Do not waste  on food I have had Ribs too soft and drenched in BBQ sauceFish sandwich fish sticks Brown lettuce Hamburger dry bun no flavorWings the worst slimy And others as well Youve been warnedBest and only thing is good music nice deck w water views and drinks on a summer night or day Live music is fun Awesome for hanging out w drinks Not a food placeDont waste your money  Bought an 1800 suite here last September and its already falling apart in less than 1 year  Its LITERALLY FALLING APART  The fabric is worn in the crotch and the seams are showing severe signs of wear and tear  Ive never had it dry cleaned and have only wore it 34 times per month in the last 10 monthsI was initially reluctant to purchase from Stiched in the first place because of their shady reviews regarding their tailoring  When I addressed these issues to their staff prior to my purchase the sales man used phrases like we have new tailors those are old reviews and we now have the best tailors on the strip Dont be fooled  When trying to come to an amicable resolution with the manager 10 months later he too said Im sorry and we stand behind our product  This was BS because he didnt care about resolving this issue in a reasonable manner  Shame on you Stiched  Ive had suits from the Mens Wearhouse that have lasted much longer The only resolution that the manager offered was that hed sell me another pair of pants that wont match the existing jacket at a discounted price  Im sorry but this is completely unacceptable  I will never buy from Stiched again nor would I recommend you gamble with their productA door sign reads hiring enthusiastic energetic and humorous employees  so I walkin Immediately my expectations are exceeded as a lady behind the desk responds to a radio call from the staff upstairs announcing that her radio which is strapped to her body vibrates every time someone calls her and she kinda likes it I couldnt help but laugh out loud the first 30 seconds I walked through the door Super savvy humorous and fun This is one novelty shop you dont want to pass up I left with unique childrens books  hand puppets for my son silly sticky notes for my secretarys desk witty comic novels and an irresistible coin pouch Its more than shopping in here its a whole experience Go in get lots for awhileIve been going here for three years Lucy and Laura are the best but everyone is great  the manager is amazing I love her I trust all of their work I get pedicures full set and wax regularly here And they send out a Christmas coupon to customers Check them out I didnt spend quite enough time in here to give this a totally legit review but when me and my friend walked in it was darker than most clubs inside the place was very small and very packed with creepers and the girls didnt take their tops off They just wore what looked like bikinis I just think if you go to a strip club they should show you their boobs Maybe they do and we just didnt stay long enough to see it but until I see different this place gets a 1To start I have seen this shop many times as I frequent two great restaurants next door  A few months ago my fiance and I stopped into the store to get an idea on a suit for me for our up coming wedding  We first met the son who was very nice and knowledgeable  I recently returned to the shop when it was time to finally purchase a suit as our wedding is getting close  I was helped by Maragita and sold a nice suit She initially gave me a good deal and I felt satisfied with the experience  LET ME TELL YOU HOW THINGS CHANGED ONCE THEYVE GOT YOUR MONEY The suite was ordered from the manufacturer and arrived about ten days later When I went to pick it up I tried it on for any necessary alterations  I was quoted an extra 115 to make it fit  Now I understand all suits need some alterations but this was major work needed  I took the suit to get some comparison quotes to fit it which were cheaper  I decided to return to the shop to see if the would work with me in coming to an arrangement since I was not happy with the way the experience was going  A 200 suit now was costing me 315 when i was under the impression that any alterations were included  I expressed my displeasure with Margarita who became very defensive  I explained that I felt lead a stray in buying the suit since I tried the pants on in front of her and she knew how much alterations the would need  I understand that alterations are time consuming and people arent going to work for free   I suggested a 50 discount and offered to pay 65 to meet me in the middle  She did not accept this and was unwilling to work with me at all in satisfying my displeasure  She even had the attitude that it was some how my fault for not knowing how these things work  I informed her that she wasnt really doing much to keep me business and she stated that she had many happy customers and didnt need my return business  CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SATISFACTION IS NOT A CONCERN FOR THIS STORE  MARGARITA HAD NO INTEREST IN TRYING TO WIN MY REPEAT BUSINESS ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY YOURE OWN YOUR OWN I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS SHOP TO ANYONEI am not one to complain about my food but my clam pasta dish was so salty when the waitress asked me how everything was I had to say something She was very nice and offered me another dish but I declined Then the owner came over and seemed pissed I complained about the food and then when she asked my wife why she did not want to take her calamari home she told her it was kinda bland but not to worry about it she got  even more pissed Then the owner said well I brought you a cannolli I hope it is not to salty or bland for you and walked away My wife and I where open mouthed I will never return after being treated like that If you do NOT want to hear how the food was from the customer then dont ask I also think the owner was drinking and maybe thats why she was so mean I run a business of my own and if I ever heard of one of my employees talking to a customer like that I would fire them on the spotWent here for lunch was busy but food and service were greatCute little shop and delicious coffee They have all the regular stuff with a few specialty drinks The menu is mixed in with some fancy italian terms  I decided to go with moka which was a really good choice And without knowing what egg cream chocolate is my friend ordered it out of curiosity We were told that it was made out of sparkling water they use san pellegrino I believe as they also sell that as bottled drinks chocolate syrup and foamed milk It was served on ice I have never had the combination of milk and sparkling water and it is surprisingly good Good option for noncoffee drinkersThe best part It is 2 doors down from a popcorn storewhich is also a local favorite too expect lines out the door We ended up sitting outside enjoying coffee and popcorn for the rest of the afternoonFantastic The black bean fritters were as good as everyone said and I loved the Pork Paradise My boyfriend had the ropa vieja and loved it  He also thought the black bean rice mixture was the best he ever had  The sangria was good but the mojito was the best Highly recommend  If I am ever back in Scottsdale this place will be on the listI will say make a reservation since its pretty busy on a weekend  We got seated quickly with a reservation  Our server was excellent despite how busy it was  He was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle  The manager was also great  We werent in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended  I will say this  they know how to treat their customers Well definitely be back Ive been going to Fujos for the last 5 months or so and I must say that after a long day of work their seafood su and dragon roll always hit the spot  They also have Chinese food if you actually want your fish cooked  And the service is consistently fast and friendly  Five starsTook their free class Really helped to get us started brewing Now were on our third batch in and the staff has been nothing but helpful Their kits make it easy to get started as well Go try it outThis is a great venue even if youre not a Member    The Club is open for breakfast and lunch MondayFriday and dinner

definitely one of the best clubs in the country My boyfriend and I love going to strip clubs and we had a blast here Great energy all around friendly staff friendly girls fun atmosphere If you are ever in the Phoenix area this is the place to check out The area is pretty bad but its safe there Not sure on the prices but lap dances are around 1020 and VIP is around 300 for an hour You can correct me on thatIm rarely blown away by coffee  I mean McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts make some reasonably tasty coffee at very affordable prices  Ive never been a fan of Starbucks too bitter and expensive  But when I can I will frequent local coffee shops looking for something amazing  Well La Prima is that something amazingI first encountered their coffee at Coca Cafe  I dont usually taste coffee and say Wow that coffee is really good  But on the occasion where I first tasted La Prima thats exactly what I said  That was months ago and I dont know why it took me so long to make it down to their shop in the Strip  Perhaps because it is the summer and one of the last things on my mind during this time is hot beverages  Now every time I brew some of those fresh beans I feel like Im treating myself and I enjoy the taste of just the coffee without adding sugar andor cream Its a very welcoming place if not a bit overwhelming with all the choices  But if youre in the Strip and looking for a good cup of coffee La Prima Espresso Company is highly recommended5 stars  Love this place  Already a ton of yelpers have yelped about Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe   I am sure most of them are similar to my love for this placeSpicy Beef Noodle BowlEvery time I visit from Chicago I run over here before or after visiting Primantis  Ive even demanded we stop here before returning home  I buy enough coffee to last me 6 months when I know I will return again  Its the best place in Pittsburgh to buy coffee  tea in bulk  I buy a coffee to drink as I shop a few bags in bulk for family members and a ton of smaller bags for myself at work  They even have flavoredhoney filled straws for tea cigars and all sorts of accessories  I love stopping here during the holiday season  I make a huge gift basket for my parents  And its all at a great priceI used to love this place and had been a regular client for nearly 2 years However they have forever lost my business Went in for gel manicurepedicure Took forever and I had to rush out to get to another commitment Later that evening I was called and told that they made a mistake and had undercharged me The girl went silent  waiting for my response I was shocked that they were calling to ask me to come back I explained that I was leaving to go out of town the next day and she asked where I currently was and if I could come back that night Could not believe the nerve When I got back from town I received an additional call When you make the mistake you eat the cost I cant think of anything more tacky than telling an existing client who has spent hundreds of dollars at your business to come back and pay HORRIBLE business practice  Never going back and will tell others not to waste their time or money at a business that treats clients this wayI can hardly believe how highly rated this restaurantwine bar is I have been twice and both times was treated to high prices poor and condescending service and mediocre foodOnce I ordered a veggie plate specifically because the menu stated that it included haricot verts When the plate came they were not on it I questioned the server and she said they were out of season but had not bothered to tell me in advance that the menu item would not be as described Against my better judgment I went back a second time with a wine tasting group Some political thing was to take place in the restaurant hours later It was being set up for so we were shunted to some tables we didnt want service was abysmal and the food and wine were really overpriced for what we received I will never go backThe JCC has a great gym I highly recommend going to Lyns zumba classes which are free to all members She has a strong dance background and shes very energetic and easy to followMy husband and I are frequent diners at PF Changs and we genuinely love it  We typically steerclear of chain restaurants but we always make an exception for PF Changs  Weve been going there for years and we have never had a bad meal  There are some dishes that we like better than others but we have never had a subpar dining experience   The food is consistently good and the service is always excellentMy husband and I dined at PF Changs last night Saturday night and we brought another couple with us  I made online reservations earlier in the day and had no trouble getting the time that I wanted 630   When we arrived the parking lot was expectedly full so we took advantage of the free valet parking  The restaurant was very very busythere people waiting outside as well  We arrived just after 630 and they had us seated within 5 minutes  We started with drinksBlue Moon for my husband Asian Pear Mojito for me Delicious Bacardi  Coke and Red Wine for our friends  For appertizers we ordered Pork Dumplings and Chicken Lettuce Wraps  When the runner brought the Chicken Lettuce Wraps he made a comment that the 4 of us shouldnt have to share just one dishso a few minutes later he arrived with another dish and more lettuce on the house  Very nice way to start off our meal   To me its those types of gestures that kicks PF Changs up a notch or two and we have had a handful of these types of gestures over the years   The lettuce wraps were hot fresh flavorful and delicious  The Pork Dumplings were also very tastyOn to the entreesTuna Tataki Crisps for me  They are so excellent  Round fried wonton as the vessel topped with Seared Ahi Tuna topped with diced Ahi tuna cucumber and scallions tossed in a citrussesame soy sauce  The crisp wonton and the soft tasty tuna are perfect together  Mongolian Beef for my husband  This is the best Mongolian Beef that we have found to date  The sauce is scrumptious the meat is lean tender and moist and the scallions add a nice freshness to the dishOur friends ordered Orange Peel Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles and they both loved their dishesFor the table to shareGarlic Noodles my favorite  I CRAVE these Noodles  The menu describes this dish as Egg noodles tossed with garlic and chili pepper flakes  However that description doesnt do it justice  The noodles are tender the sauce is savory but not too powerful and it has a touch of sweetness and its topped with julienned cucumber and fresh Cilantro  Outstanding served fresh even better eaten cold out of the fridge the next dayif it makes it that long   Ive been known to order an extra to take to a cookout the next dayPork Fried Rice my husbands favorite  Everyone has their fried rice preferences  For us we dont like sticky fried rice we dont like it over seasoned over salty and we dont like too many veggies especially the frozen peas and carrots that most takeout establishments like to use  Changs Fried Rice is made with egg julienne carrots bean sprouts sliced scallions and just the right amount of soy sauce  PerfectWe completed our meal with a couple of dessert minisTiramisu and Lemon Dream  Both were tasty and just the right size following a big meal  Excellent meal once again  We all left full satisfied and happy  We will continue to dine to PF Changs over and over again  Yes we really love it that much  The dishes may not be authentic but there is something to be said for consistently delicious Asianinspired food  For us PF Changs is the restaurant equivalent of a familiar and reliable friend  We all have many acquaintances that we enjoy but the reliable friends are few and far betweenPS Ive posted pictures of the entreesOk let me get it right out there This fabulous local spot in the same strip center as my own business But after years of eating here I am not sure why they fly so far under the radar with the foodie crowd The service is top notch and ya know Im a picky girl about this Some of the servers have been there since the place openedIt is family owned and operated and they insist on high quality ingredients The prices are fair and the portions are large I am a huge fish fan and these guys  deliver up some amazingly well prepared Mediterranean style fish dishes They serve soup and salad with their entrees and the bread is worth the splurgeI enjoy their wine selection and this summer there is a great wine special Mondays through Thursdays I invite all my foodie friends to give it a tryWe stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie Our server was friendly My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to meBoth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol  After I finished my drink I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find to my disgust a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap Ugg Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap She comped the drink but we wont be backCant speak about the food since we didnt have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourselfI really like this place it is very intimate with very few seats for each show so there is not a bad seat in the house  Not all the acts are the greatest but it is a great value and its even great when comics are not doing well because you are still laughing at them  The drinks are a little pricy but if not for that I am not even sure how they would make money  I think for that it is a very fair value for live entertainment and very great date night place to check out every month or two  I live so far so it is an evening out for us when we make it out here but well worth the drive  I saw a Quentin D cant remember his last name but they show was so awesome and he was so funny I nearly pissed myself  The shows before him were not as good but they werent bad either  It also seemed like the show lasted 2 hours in total  I have to say that this place pretty much rocks and since it is in old town you can go bar hopping right afterwardIts been yearsbut I loved going to shows here while I attended ISU  Very intimate venue to see your fave bands play with good food and libationsEvery time Im at Town Square I go and get a honey milk tea with boba   so yummythe prices are a bit much for the size of the cup but its that good yes  its really that great  some time there is a line for all the tourests but it can be fun to just sit and people watch as you sip pure pleasureI went on a Tuesday night 101111 around 10 pm Have been here in the afternoon but not at night The cover was only 5 and they still had the 2 4 1 specials There was a variety of hot dancers so I got a seat against the wall and had some dances from a hot blonde  a super hot Latina and a hot and sexy seductive Hawaiian  The Hawaiian is who I spent most time with She had a tight sexy seductive body and crawled all over me They were all very very close dances There was skin on skin contact and damn she smelled good Even though it was a slow night they still had a large variety of dancers Everytime I am in town I check out this club and they never disappoint Last time I was here was September 1 and it was the Hawaiians  first night she was fantastic One tip if you are getting a hot dance in the main room you know the VIP will be hot If the lap dance is not hot and you hope it gets hotter in VIP it wont  Believe me on this Even if you dont go VIP you will have a  good time I have been to the other establishments including the nude bars but find this is the one place that never disappoints The food is good the dancers are hot great drink specials and the bouncers are chillI have been seen by Dr Dan for years He is excellent Nd spends time with his patients to give them the best care possible He is worth the visit if you would like to be back to your normal self againThe fact that its overpriced is pretty apparent but their service SUCKSTake Cindy for example who took care of our party of 9  For some reason I think she didnt like me because I wanted warm water  When I asked for the said item she responded with We have tea  jasmine oolong etc  I asked her again Do you have warm water  She says Yes but we have tea  OK I get the fucking point  You have tea and youre trying to charge me for it but I dont fucking want itWhilst taking my order Cindy didnt understand when I pointed to what I wanted and specified chicken  Because instead she tells me i can choose from bbq pork duck or chicken  I said yeah that chicken  OK that wasnt even the worse partWhen she brought back everyones dishes my order was missing  However she had a two bbq item rice plate in her hand  I realized the person next to me had switched her order at the last minute and Cindy the server must have accidentally switched my order  Cindy hands me the rice plate and says Here you go  I told her I didnt order this  You must have accidentally switched my order out instead of the person next to me  Cindy responds with You dont want this  I said NO I didnt order this  I ordered the poached chicken rice noodle  Cindy says Oh and runs offShe does indeed come back with the right order but never offers an apology  She gave me a fat attitude during the whole damn timeAnd the noodles  Well Ive had better  And it never cost me 1350I would never recommend Noodles to anyoneProbably THE best card and gift store in the East End of Pittsburgh if not the entire city  Even the picky and indecisive card shopper such as myself can find plenty of good choices  Need a present to go along with that card  You can make a onestop trip to Kards Unlimited  There are toys for both kids and adults gag gifts like beer goggles books bath and body products ornaments and what is my favorite to look at funky jewelry  If youre shopping for a literary friend a bunch of the paper collagestyle necklace pendants incorporate literary references Why yes I would like one  Even if youre not shopping for a lovable female book nerd the jewelry is beautifulThe aisles can get cramped with people browsing but you cant blame themtheres just so much to seeWell the administration fee is true and now I will not be going back  You have got to be kidding me  Like someone stated earlier I pay a copay every time I go in there and they bill my insurance for anything additional they do  This is total BS  I thought I was going to the doctor not a gym  The Doctors are good there but it is soooo slow  If you have a 10am appointment dont expect to get in before at least 1030amI called and I was told this fee was to offset the cost of the Lab EMR and Patient Portal cost  Im not sure what Lab they are referring to because every time I have blood drawn they send it off to some place called LabCorp  Isnt this the cost of doing business  So should I start deducting a set amount for the employees that work for me for the cost of internet and the payroll system we use  I dont think soI have been going to the Perry Monge Salon for about 14 years  I love this place  If you are Latina have curly hair and cannot find anyone to cut your hair andor style it because of the curl this is your place  Saturdays are busy but I try to avoid them  I am lucky I work downtown so I am able to make an appt right after work and not have to deal with the craziness of Saturdays  Being a client for so long I have tried their spa waxing services and of course hair services and and happy with everything  I have even recommended this salon to many friends and family all of whom are still loyal clients  An added bonus my husband and I joined the Aveda Pure Privilege program it took us approx 4 years of saving our points but in 2011 we had a 6 night stay in Jamaica  It was absolutely wonderful  We stayed at the Caves in Negril complete with complimentary massages  Since then we have saved another 44000 points and are looking forward to booking our 3 night stay in Antigua next year when we reach 50000 pointsOMG  Hands down the best pancakes I have ever put in my mouth Sometimes I day dream about Dor Stop pancakes  Too bad I live 6 hours away or Id go there everyday  The service was just ok but the place was packed and the food was well worth the waitI attended a work dinner here at Red Square at Mandalay The waitstaff was friendly but very inept They delivered a wine that was two years more recent than ordered and continued to bungle The stroganoff was not as food as the hamburger helper version Id avoid this place especially for the moneyYou may end up here on Sat night if all the other area bars are busyIm not going to come down too hard on this place because it wasnt my choice to come here One of the locals led a group of guys here initially just to have one shot He lives in the Avenue and knows the bar owner and several of the staff  We got quick and efficient service at a great priceand ended up staying for a few rounds of beers after a round of shotsThis place is rough watch your back There is a lot of drama and the kind of place where testosterone mixed with alcohol can make for a volatile mixThis was technically the Clarion hotel so I think the name is wrong on the page Id like to start by saying that Im not much of a complainer but if could have given 0 stars I would have So we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it I assumed it was leaking and brushed it off I dont care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there After a great hockey game and a bar crawl we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed There was absolutely no hot water for my shower So cold I wouldnt even consider hopping in really quick It was late so I let it go and decided to try again in the morning When I woke up it was the same thing At this point I was fuming I NEED a shower manSo I put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator Right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor What the hell is pretty much what I was thinking at this point Well there was my shower considering I had to walk through it to continue on my quest As soon as the elevator doors open to the first floor I see the hallway is flooded The carpet is squishing beneath my feet all the way to the front desk where other angry people had beaten me to Apparently a pipe had burst the day before and they had neglected to tell us that when we had checked in I was so mad I managed to get 70 off our bill and I made her call to check us in at another hotel I would have insisted the whole bill be paid for but Im really bad at being mean to people All in all I will never stay here or any other branch of this hotel againstaff is friendly enoughdrs are quick and dont really listen or ask any questions ive changed drs since my last visit and am very happy i had an appt that i had rescheduled here and they keep sending and will not stop sending a letter asking me to pay for a missed visit when i called to cancel a week before found a way better drlittle better to drive but at least i feel like im getting the customer service i deserveThis was the worst least professional spa service Ive ever received The girl waxing my brows talked at me the entire time so much so that I wondered whether or not she could possibly be focusing on what she was doing After 15 minutes spewing out of a partial life story and some pretty horrific gum smacking inches from my face all on HER parth ha my brows were done They were decently shaped nothing special but the clean up was atrocious I had errant hairs that I had to request my esthetician pluck and she did while I stood up However when I got home I still had to clean up myself Bad bad bad and it cost twice as much as any perfectly decent salon wax I wish Id had something even NEAR the experience other yelpers have hadIm a newbie in Pittsburgh and have lived in California almost all of my life Most recently I was living in the San Francisco Bay Area where dope lounges clubs cafes are bountiful Ever since the first time I stepped foot in Shadow Lounge a sense of familiarity and peace overwhelmed me Gotta give it up to the owner Justin for creating such a unique and welcoming venue in Pittsburgh I can honestly say that both Shadow and Ava Lounge have become one of my new favorite kick it spots hands downVisiting Charlotte from Los Angeles while husband is in town for business The good The upstairs dining room has a live band and lively atmosphere People are talking loud and enjoying themselves Have a drink before your dinner comes for an even better time We each had a glass of wine The sauce from the barbeque shrimp was the best part of our meal Not the shrimp the sauce with bread dipped inThe bad Food is mediocre We had the Cajun popcorn which is fried crawfish that comes out partially covered in a remoulade sauce Good but on the salty side Tell them to put the sauce on the side when you order so you can dip instead The sauce took away from the dish and the ones that were smothered in the sauce remained on the place uneaten We each had a cup of seafood gumbo There is no meat other than seafood in the gumbo yay but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless We ordered a large order of the barbeque shrimp and I got a side order of grits The sauce in the barbeque shrimp was spicy and delicious dip the bread from your bread basket in this tasty broth The shrimp were on the small and limp side not memorable at all as far as texture The final insult the grits Grits are a favorite food of mine Im a southern girl and make real deal bombazz grits at home The grits at Cajun Queen were those instant add boiling water to reconstitute grits Culinary blasphemyI will not return If you want real grits go to Merts Heart and SoulIf you like authentic Chinese food like me you will love this place I am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons hereI guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and Americanized food I never tried the Americanized dishes but the Chinese ones are decent I always just order their specials which are listed on the first page of their menuMy favorite dishes are Chinese style mapo tofu Beijing duck you need to order it ahead fish with the spicy sauce The spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers It has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug  and the pork stir fry with bamboo shootsGreat place for authentic south east Asian cuisine Malay Indo Chinese I have been here once before and really enjoyed the food Having spent time in Indonesia it is hard to find true authentic food from there This is the only place in Charlotte for the real deal If Ian is in ask for him to help you make your food selection There is much that isnt on the menu Ian is the bartender an server He is Malay and speaks excellent English and has an amazing amount of knowledge about the culture and food influences throughout the SE Asian peninsula Ian hooked us up last night with some outstanding Malay dishes We had sea bass that was lightly battered with a mouth watering curry with eggplant green beans okra and onions The spices in this dish blended perfectly well and I began to understand some of the differences between Indonesian and Malay cuisine that Ian had tried to explain We also had the beef rendang that was tender and fragrant This is slow cooked beef in coconut milk and spices We topped off our meal with a Asian style flat pancake folded over some ground  peanuts and palm sugar that was grilled in a pan to blend the flavors and served with vanilla ice cream  The only thing that could have enhanced this dish might be a drizzle of chocolate sauce YumWe look forward to returning and having Ian take care of us againHow to put this gentlyWhile I may go back to Pittsburgh some day I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art Its not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st in sf It comes down to the fact that a docent while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it told the students it was a watchtower from Auschwitz a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews  Seriously Thats how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers It sounded like she described a bad breakfast jointoh that place they basically just fry eggsOn top of all that the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitlers rule ie not those in AuschwitzIn sum docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer and this one sucked So Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh if youre going to hire racist people to lead your tours at least make sure they have their facts straight or can readYuck I  hadnt eaten here in years and it will be years until I return The wonton soup was watery and the wontons were inedible I ordered pepper steak wwhich they substituted pork sparerib meat and I surmised that they didnt think I would notice Also I think the health dept needs to perhaps male a visitthe place is dirtyThe 9 Steak And Lobster on Thursdays is Out Of This WorldCheap food and great entertainment what more could ask forFunctional Performance Center is a clean large physical therapy facility I went in for back issues that I have had for years and the physical therapist Shelley was able to help me I have gone to chiropractors for years but have not seen anything but immediate relief however with no improvement Shelley not only taught me more about my bodymuscles and how they work together but showed me proper technique when stretching and doing certain exercises I have also met with the other therapist Derek Steveson and he does exceptional work as well He is certified in more than just physical therapy and you know immediately that he has had many years in the field  Everyone is very friendly and the front desk assistants were very helpful in helping me schedule my next appointment I will continue going here for physical therapy Not only is it a good workout but I enjoy the atmosphere and the people who help meGreat location  I love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread  Love love love the smiley cookies Get the fish Skip the chips Few things are better than a madetoorder handbreaded fresh fish sandwich This catfish filet was NOT frozen The cornmeal breading was very crunchy Cooked perfectly Light flaky NOT greasy at all Just a perfect sandwich all around Get this the combo plate was only 650 Seriously AwesomeWhen asked if I wanted hot sauce or mayo on the sandwich I replied both BEST DECISION EVER The hot sauce adds the necessary flavor to the mildly seasoned breading while the mayo provides the creaminess that a tartar sauce adds without the overwhelming tartar flavor Note Im not a big tartar sauce fan bc it hides the flavor of the fishSo skip the fries Theyre just frozen potatoes that dont taste like anything Im still giving Mandys 5 stars because the sandwich was truly exceptional And honestly didnt come for the fries But ask them which sides are made on site The onion rings and fried okra are probably good PSdont worry about it being catfish Its seriously goodPPSI grew up around a LOT of fish fries in Kentucky No catfish has ever been this good GOIve been driving past Sophies for 3 years now and finally took the opportunity to go for happy hour On Friday night they have half price bar appetizers and my husband and I split 3 dishes and were blown awayWe ordered the escargot which was very tender and delicious and had a very authentic rich flavour The smoked salmon was perfect with the creme fresh sauce and toasted baguettes on the side The most amazing dish we sampled was the Noisettes de boeuf which is essentially small tender pieces of beef wrapped in very lean bacon in a Dijon mustard sauce This was seriously the most amazing beef that Ive ever had and Im typically not a steak person We ended up ordering a second helping of it since it was really that goodWe finished off the night with a delectable Creme Brulee and it brought me back to my days living in France It was the perfect ending to an incredible mealThe owner of the restaurant is extremely friendly and sat down at the bar to chat with us for a while The bistro has a very warm and inviting atmosphere and the patio is beautiful at night This place isnt snobby like a lot of French restaurants and the staff is very responsiveWe ended up spending about 100 between the drinks and 4 appetizers BTW  the Mango Martini is to die for but the whole experience was really worth it Tuesday night is ladies night with halfprice wine by the glass and Ill be back again soon for thatkeywords french food 85016 french cuisine biltmore area french bistro arcadia area

go to Little Darlings But if you want A Customer Service in a flash go with Spearmint Rhino instead Your loss Little Darlings was going to spoil my love rotten that night at your club oPThis place is great to check out anytime of year Its always so beautiful and amazing w what they have on display each time I come here  The last time I was here was in October and they had a really cute display for Autumna nice little bridge that goes through the greenery and water fountains that shoot up and over the bridge as youre walking through a GIANT bucket of bright green red and yellow apples flowing from it It was amazing check out the pix i postedIts a great spot for photos especially during the holidays and the greatest part about it is that its FREE Ahhh my favorite place for tailoring Us short people rely on places like Artful Tailoring Its been a while since I have been in but I have given them everything from my Lucky Brand sweats to Ann Taylor slacks to an old pair of jeans for mending Ive never had a bad experience here and their prices are fair Service is fantastic and you can count on your clothes being ready when promised The store is clean and has an upscale feel Aladdin is knowledgeable and friendly They are great at difficult jobs or specialty items too Wont ever go anywhere elseVery unprofessional and sketchy staff  all the other yelp reviews will confirm thisYou know a nursing home is bad when you call to get information on your family member who is receiving care and the rudeilliterate nurse you get a hold of refuses to identify themselves  wont even give you their first name  What kind of nursing home hires people like thatLater we found out my family member ended up hospitalized due to dehydration  They refused to assist my family get information about his care after he was discharged  that was the word they kept throwing around even to my family member while he was still there waiting for an ambulanceIf you are considering placing a family member in this facility read these reviews and also this news story httpwww8newsnowcomstory23140454nursingThey are out of businessI was so excited about finding a place in Charlotte that sells fresh pasta and sauces   We were greated with questions about where we parked our car and if we were coming in the store or restaurant next door  Walked inside to be greated with head banging music that made me want to stab my ears out  Found a freezer full of sausage with the sell as date of 424 three days ago frightening   Go to the counter to find no fresh ravioli all frozen also all frozen Capavetti and Gnocchi  All types of sauces are also frozen except one The kid at the counter is explaining to be how frozen ravioli is better  Whatever  The display had a sign for three types of Focacci  I asked for 2 of the 3 no luck   I bought the rosemary Focacci and its sold warm and its not bad   I also decided to try a frozen Florantine ravioli and frozen Gnocchi   They packed the warm bread in the bag on top of the frozen pasta   Unbelievable   I will report back on the quality of the half defrosted pasta after I cook it  Very disappointed in this placeHad Snail do a scooter frame for me I was trying to save money and go with a cheaper option but they hooked it up with an awesome pearl multistage After that had me do a set of wheels that came out perfect mounted and balanced as well Powder coat isnt cheap but they were half as much as any other quotes I got I send everybody I know thereAlaric and his business Earth Spirit Center for Healing is such a wonderful place to visit Alarics teachings for inner peace are profound and effective Anyone who needs more peace love or joy in their lives needs to go see Alaric Not only is he the best in town at what he does his pricing is very affordable You owe it to yourself to see what Alaric can do for you I have been a life coaching client of his and I am now a student and I have attended the Sunday morning Circle of Peace The whole community is wonderful I can not recommend Earth Spirit Center for Healing highly enoughWhen you first drive up to Shadyside you dont expect much but we were very much happy with what we got  The parking lot does have a steep driveway but not too bad  We went to the lobby and we were met by two ladies who immediately offer us water and cookies Before leaving the lobby we were given a bag for a Sunday breakfast  In the bag bottle of orange juice apple juice two small muffins two granola bars and mints  The room we were put in look like a small  apartment  Living roomdinning area and kitchen  It also had two separate bedrooms one was a single and the other was full  This place was very clean and comfortableThis is my second time in Pittsburgh the first time we stayed in a hotel we had to pay for parking go to an elevator to take us up to the lobby and take another elevator to get to our room and had to pay for WIFi  I would recommend Shadyside and would love to stay there again and againI had an extremely unpleasant experience at my recent visit to Pole Poistion raceway My boyfriend and I have been looking forward to our trip to Las Vegas for a long time Pole Position being one of our top prioritiesUnfortunately the faculty were less than friendly especially the boys running the track area There were 4 people ejected from my race for accidentally running into barriers These cars are extremely powerful and fast and for someone who has never driven one before it is easy to get out of control Being a beginner myself I was the first person to crash and was threatened to be ejected and spoken to like I was a dumb child who had never driven a car before This was demoralizing not to mention embarrassing being that these boys yelling at me were younger than myselfAfter my crash I could hear the boys running the track area saying that their groups of racers were stupid today Listen boys if you dont like your job get a new one I felt it would have helped to do a slow practice run around the track before each race being that there are several accident prone areas that come up quickly to someone like me who has never raced the track beforeMy disappointment in Pole Position has caused me to recommend  NOT going there and I myself my boyfriend and our friend who went with us will not return eitherI went today at 5pm and there was no indication that it was closed as the sign said open on TuesSun until 1030pm I came in with a group of 4 others and one man greeted us and asked us how big was our party We replied 5 and he said he was the only worker there and we were too big for him He looked extremely confused as to why we showed up and the rest of the place was empty He didnt explain to us if there were workers that were supposed to show up or if we would expect abnormally long wait times or if today was an anomaly because of the snow He basically just turned us away We wanted hotpot so it literally requires him to turn on a burner and slice meat He doesnt even have to cook What is the point of leaving the restaurant open or even running a restaurant if you dont adhere to your hours of opening Genuinely confused at how and when to eat at this placeIf youre headed to Scottsdale and looking to play some golf make a trip out to Quintero Golf and Country Club This course is a little ways off the beaten track but it will be an experience youll remember Temporary clubhouse only This course is semiprivate and if youre not a member you need to buy a Troon card to be able to make a tee time Worth every penny though because it is rated in thetop 100 courses in America and truly a remarkable golf experienceQuick service amazing coffee nice vibethis is the perfect time of year to visit DBGin spring they start their spring jazz in the garden series every firday night with food and cash bar beveragesyou can take painting classes just stroll around and now they have this awesome art installation piece made of twigs that you can actually go inside of completed Feb 23ive been coming here since i was a little un and i love coming back especially if youre a native youll love the desert rain  machine its basically a strainer with creosote and other desert plant leaves inside and you turn on the shower fountain head and get an instant whiff of true monsoon season desert rain smellits amazingIt was my very first time pawning anything in my entire life I entered EZ Pawn and was helped by a team of very nice gentlemen My item was appraised and I was given a good amount My transaction was completed quickly and easily Everyone at EZ Pawn was extremely helpful and provided me with superior customer service I would recommend EZ Pawn to anyone even those who are first timers like myself Five stars who knew pawn shops were so nice Absolute worst service Ive ever had and Ive been to a lot of Chinese restaurants All the other times Ive been here nothing worth mentioning but the most recent time will be my last timeNow I dont know who all the titles of the staff so Ill just refer to them as waiters and busers I think we had 2 servers and 23 busers throughout the course of our meal23 because I think I saw two busers that looks identical and Im not being racist because Im Chinese myself so Ill just count them both as one personWe first get there and put in our order I didnt keep track of time but probably after 2030 minutes we get our appetizer still no soup though and thats supposed to come first  Buser 1 delivers the appetizer but practically drops the dish on the table with a loud thud and immediately walks away About 1020 minutes later the other dishes started coming The worst dish was the sizzling pepper steak The thing about this dish is when it comes to your table the steak is supposed to be sizzling in the metal tray In our case it came out at room temperature meat and metal pan so as you can expect absolutely no sizzleSometime throughout the meal we asked Buser 1 if were supposed to get soup He responds by saying dont ask him ask the waiter So we ask one of the waiters and he apologizes and says hell get us soup About 10 minutes later we still havent received the soup so we dont really bother anymore The waiter walks by and asks if we have received our soup yet which we said not yet and he could tell by the lack of soup bowls He immediately gets someone again to bring out soup This time Buser 2 puts the bowl of soup down not sure where his mind is at but drops the soup spoon into the bowl and splashes all of us with soup my mom suffering the most splash damage He says sorry once but for an incident like that I think you should be more apologeticAfter a few more dishes arrive we ask for rice which is not something that you should need to do yourself at a Chinese restaurantFinally when were done eating we ask Buser 1 for some togo boxes He goes and brings back boxes and before he walks away says Ask someone else to do it WTF kind of attitude is thatIn the end they had the audacity to charge us 18 gratuity on a party of 4 with dreadful service Overall the food was decent but it was PAINFUL to eat with that degree of serviceStopped in here for a late lunch as I saw this place had high recommendations  It took some time to get waited on  There was only 2 tables with people eating and another group of several persons were leaving  The staff were inconsiderate and just kept standing and talking and taking photos with these people who were on their way out  I wanted something that was not hot and spicy so I ordered the chicken sandwich  Waitress asked me if I wanted mushrooms and cheese on it so I asked if the mushrooms were fresh  She said they were so I told her to put them on  One bite into the sandwich and I knew they were not fresh mushrooms bur canned I sat there for some time waiting for someone to ask me how everything was but nobody ever checked back with me  I got up and left  As I was leaving I mentioned to the gal at the counter how disappointed I was and she acted like she didnt hear me and asked me if I was walking out without paying  I told her I was not going to pay for something I could not eat and should have been told that the mushrooms were canned and not freshVery disappointing food and waste of my timeThe area this place is located in is not a very good area and I would advise people to not go after darkThe BEST Chinese in charlotte My boyfriend and I are regulars there The food is amazing and the fish tanks are beautiful If you are a vegetarian like myself they have plenty of option I get the mixed veggies in brown sauce SO GOODVery nice people and very welldone pedicure Very reasonable Will definitely be backI decided to check this place out after having driven by it numerous times and had a few friend say that they liked the place a fair deal  I was hungry and craving chinese so why not I figuredCalled in to see if they were open and they were but hearing that they had an hour wait I elected to carry out  1520 minutes is about average so I didnt say boo  25 minute prep time isnt too far outside of the estimate and they were busy after allThe barbecue pork lomein was not the best ever  Pork had a fatty texture and the dish as a whole was okay though a bit bland  The duck won ton soup was pretty goodRight until I got to the meat  Almost every piece had either bones or bone chips in it  I am not sure if that is a normal part of how its made but I have never experienced the like before and it was a put offThe experience over the phone and waiting was fair  The place was packed due to being one of the rare places open Christmas night  and I understand the pressure of being a host or hostess in this situation but I saw this girl loose her composure a few times in the 15 minutes I was there once pretty majorlyWith the bones fatty flavor and other worries I managed a few bites overall before my 20 meal went into the garbage disposal or trash  Im stunned with the overwhelming good reviews as my experience was so weak as I had pretty much a poor experience overall and a lot of disappointmentI may or may not give them another shot in the future  At the moment I doubt itHave you ever left a place and thought What took me so long to get here That happened to me at Fujos My girlfriends and I celebrated my birthday here and the sushi and drinks knocked my socks off Yep Im officially a fan Id recommend this place to anyone looking for some good and reasonably priced sushi We started with the steamed pork dumplings Classic I also ordered the Rainbow Martini its cranberry vodka pineapple and midori The presentation was excellent and they were VERY heavy handed with the liquor  And theres really just no need to go on and on about just how happy that made the birthday girl That thing is deliciousBut lets get to what everyone wants to know aboutthe sushi I ordered the Godzilla Roll and decided after the first bite its officially my go to roll when Im here I clearly see why its mentioned in so many reviews and why its listed as a must try on the menu Its packed with spicy tuna avocado and then deep fried tempura style My goodness How could you go wrong with that combination  Do yourself a favor and get over to Fujos Its definitely worth a tryThe Salomon salad for lunch was simply the best food I have eaten for 11 bucks  The service was fantastic  Sometimes I wonder if people who complain about bad service receive bad service because they are not the friendliest people themselves  I also was here for a grooms dinner and there wasnt a complaint in the party  My beef tenderloin was awesomeLoved staying here  We were going up to Madison for the day and found this place through a quick Google search of Madisonarea BBs  Craig the owner was so helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about prices and availability  He was also awesome and asked about our dietary preferences Im a vegetarian whos also temporarily glutenfree whereas my boyfriend will eat anything and promised to have a yummy breakfast we would both love  When we got to The Parsonage I was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in Madison proper  It was quiet and cozy  We picked the Mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there and also a really nice outdoor patio which was covered in snow but i bet will be awesome when spring comes   Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE i think i actually miss it  Since our room didnt have a shower which we knew when we booked  well worth it to have that awesome bathtub I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy  Breakfast the next day was so nice  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish  so yummy  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage  There was also pineapple juice and a really great tea selection  The conversation was also really nice  I like that we all ate together me my boyfriend Craig and the 5 other guests who were staying there  Great people and great company  Next time we are in the Madison area we will definitely stay here  Craig thanks for all the hospitality  From Denise and JustinI had a long day at work and my head was pounding  When I got home my wife tells me that my aunt got us free VIP tickets to see Gordie Brown at the Golden Nugget  Honestly I was tired stressed I had a headache and I didnt want to go  Good thing that my fabuloso wife convinced me otherwise  The Gordie Brown show is located in the Golden Nugget  upstairs  Going up the escalators it is a bit of a maze  Once you are in the auditorium it  is pretty small and cozy and yes very comfortable  Our seats were in the center 4 rows from the stage  Fantastic seatsHow would I best describe it  Hmm he is a very eclectic and an entertaining performer  In a way he reminds me of a Weird Al Yankovic for those who lived through the 80s  He takes old and memorable catchy songs and rewrites them with his own lyrics  In addition it is pretty amazing how he has most of his wardrobe changes on the stage  It is pretty funny and extremely entertainingOverall the music lyrics jokes and everything was fantastic  After the show I felt more relaxed and my headache was gone  A true test of a show is whether you would return and PAY to see the show again  My answer is yes I give this a five star because it was great and it was FREE  LOLEnjoyGoodbye Hotels  After this cozy little place Im a bed and breakfast faithful  Our host Craig was wonderful  It was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful  The place itself gave me the same joy I remember having when I would go see grandparents as a child  That feeling of a warm house  Oh did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning  The bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing  We stayed in the Sorenson room which was a little larger and had a couch  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine which helped us to find our restaurant the next day  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a clawfoot tub that is over 110 years old but has excellent water pressure  Shampoo soap body gel bath salts I think thats what they were and even a hairdryer are all provided  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things  For the breakfast portion we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche Ive ever had  Pardon my French My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make  He also had a myriad of drink options  Some ready to be poured some in waiting  Also for me the nonvegetarian he made an incredible side of bacon  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered  Then it was baked  Then it was devoured with great speed  Seriously this was heavenly  Also there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us Craig and his beautiful and friendly dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host  My fiance and I are planning another trip in the spring and well be sure to stay with them again  I couldt recommend this place enoughBought a Groupon here to try it out and decided to buy another because we knew wed come backGo for dinner sit outside and enjoy an amazing view of downtown something you cant really get from many uptown restaurants Views of many buildings but set back from the street just a really great location for eveningSushi they have interesting rolls like ones with sweet potatoes that Ive never seen any where else Really yummy sushi of all typesDrinks really good mixed drinks and sake Limited wine and beerService Truly excellentOn 91910 my family 6 adults 4 children 5yrs  under went to enjoy dim sum at what WAS our favorite restaurant We I reviewed the bill I noticed an unfamiliar highpriced amount on the bill I went to the cashier station and asked what was the charge for I was told it is a service charge for parties over 8 people I said there are only 6 adults and 4 children He I believe the owner just shrouded his shoulders and said thats our service charge 1925  thats an extreme charge for servicing water refills and collecting empty dim sum containers Sunday dim sum  Changs is now a thing of the past for usPing Pang Pong here we comeAlthough I have attended Louies show in the past and loved it the review below is based on my experience when I attended Marty Allens birthday show  This review originally appeared on Vegas Posh the online magazine that my husband and I maintainMarty Allen is what classic comedy is all about hes funny without being offensive charming has spotless timing and an arsenal of facial expressions that keep audiences laughing just as much as his jokes do  When Allen celebrated his 90th birthday with an engagement at the Louie Anderson Theater at Palace Station he proved to Las Vegas audiences that at 90 hes just as funny as hes ever beenAllens wife Karon Kate Blackwell started off the show by showcasing her vocal talent the kind that you only find from entertainers who had to rely on their own talent and not on hightech studio equipment  Allen appeared before a cheering crowd opening with a hilarious monologue before doing his first skit the wine taster from Caesars Palace an alcoholic whose wife is so ugly that her pictures hang themselvesThroughout Allens skits Blackwell played the straight lady but even the straight lady couldnt help but laugh at many of his jokes  The chemistry was undeniable and the two had trouble keeping straight faces throughout many of the skits including the one that featured Allen as a doctor who had just written the book Everything Youve Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask Your ChildrenBetween skits Blackwell sings dances and plays piano  Her performances included a highenergy rendition of Proud Mary and a deeply moving Beatles medleyPerhaps one of Allens funniest jokes was the story of an eight year old boy who goes to the store to purchase a box of Tampax  When the clerk asks if he knows what theyre for he responds Not really but theyre for my four year old brother we saw the commercials and they said if he bought these he would be able to swim and ride a bike and he cant do either  Commenting on modern times Allen delivered another hilarious line when he joked You know times have changed when a man goes to the drug store and says loudly Ill take a box of condoms whispering with his mouth covered  and a pack of cigarettesAlthough Allens routines are classics and many of his characters originated decades ago he keeps his act fresh and modern appealing as much to audiences today as to audiences of the past without succumbing to the trend of getting cheap laughs through vulgarity  Audiences were undoubtedly left looking forward to Allens 91st birthday celebrationMMMM From Russia with LoveThe Ice bar is beautiful and the friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff will help you negotiate through the endless varieties of  uh   wait oh yeah vodka  I recommend getting some flights and splitting them with friends Vodka has as many genres as wine and each is a brilliant ice cold experience   Gotta love those RuskiesI also have to admit that they have a beautiful logo and the Tshirt is top notchBosa donuts boasts the best donuts ive ever had They are so good you cannot just eat one By far the softest and tastiest donuts aroundMy personal favorite Pittsburgh bar Notorious for fresh juice and strong drinks For the first few years I lived in pgh this was our standard last stop before heading home Not once did I remember leaving the bar Things have slowed down a bit since then mostly because Ive also learned to never order more then two drinks Its also tiny so if you want to sit down get there early or go during the week Weekend crowds are ass to crotch throughout the entire placeA treasure trove a goldmine frankly the biggest motherload of quality classic vinyl LPs Ive ever seen  Imagine 13000 sqare feet of jazz blues soul funk rnb rock folk documentaries comedy instructionals soundtracks etc  Im really into this bar but only every now and then they get a lot of the same kinds of requests and they usually play them on rotation each weekend so i wouldnt recommend coming every weekthe musicians are good and have lively personalities to make a request you write the song on a bar napkin and walk it up to the stage and drop it on the piano top with a couple of bucks or more depending on how badly you want to hear your songps unless youre a dummy dont fall for the UofA v ASU fight song battle they do this every time i go in and basically drunken bros try to outbid one another to hear one song over the other during the rose bowl etc the respective teams are inserted anyway ive seen some poor way too drunk fool plop down 100 in effort to have his team song played over another  pretty smart gimmick for the players pretty crappy for the dude who has to to realize wait did i really pay 100 to hear a song last nighti think the drink prices are steep here but its a fun time and youre getting live entertainmentThis is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the Strip A wide variety of party favors and Pittsburgh paraphernaliaIm over in Arizona from Ireland for a few weeks work and as i play hurling in Ireland I always wanted to have a go at baseball so I dropped by here for the closest thing to it This place was as we say in Ireland UnFeckinReal The guys working there deserve a lot of credit as they were willing to point a baseball virgin like me in the right direction to pop my batting cherry They chose a suitable bat for me and after two or three shots advised me that I needed to switch my hands which made a huge difference to my batting I would and most likely will be back numerous times before I ship back out to Ireland as this place is top notch in every aspectI walked in to order carry out and interrupted a waitress smoking her hookah  She didnt even get up right away to help me guess she needed a few more hits  Service is so rude especially for this upper class area  This place is a hole in the wall  I had to wait for my food in the same area Miss Congeniality was sucking her hookah with her boyfriend  The food was just ok doesnt warrant another visitThis is probably one of the most solid restaurants we have on Pittsburghs east end  It is also a haven for the veganvegetarian hipster  Ive been a handful of times now and only once did I get food I wasnt happy with  Prices are reasonable maybe like 12 more for food than you would expect to pay  Keeping this place open is well worth that costIf you arent feeling so hungry this doubles as a coffee shop lacks some coffee shop seating and the hot drinks are solid  Check out the milkshakesLove the neighborhood everyone is friendly to me DI absolutely refuse to shop for records here After several trips spent trying to find a decent record at Jerrys I gave up and never looked back The selection is terrible They may have volume but that means nothing if its Easy Listening and Soft Rock records that you could find in better shape and cheaper at a thift store  Pittsburgh has plenty of other record stores that are worth checking out but dont waste your time here Plus youll never find a new release at JerrysDo you like feta or cheve goat cheese Crows Dairy makes the beat cheese ever They also started making gelato that is to die for While their cheese is used in a lot of restaurants you can also find them at a ton of farmers markets If you see them around definitely try itAbsolutely HORRIBLEThe worst Dim Sum I have ever hadI have been to this place a few times and enjoyed the flavors However I was VERY DISAPPOINTED for their lack of respect to what a customer orders  I order my usual the MEE GORENG with TOFU and as I combed through and had a couple of bites I found a strip of chicken  I lost my appetite and was gravely disappointed by their lack of detail to a vegetarian dish  This place is black listed for me and I hope to find a better Malaysian place in the Queen CityI was recently privileged to receive free tickets for myself and a friend to the play The Divine Sister courtesy of Yelp Elite  I have been a fan of Actors Theatre for several years  A big plus for this location is free and easily accessible parking  It offers snacks and drinks for sale that one can take into the theatre  Sometimes they offer beer and wine whose names compliment the theme of that evenings production  ATC also features Cult Movie Mondays in addition to plays and musicals  This evenings performance of The Divine Sister delivered the bawdy irreverent humor that is characteristic of this theatre  Another success in a long line of accomplishments  Thanks to Ben and JJ for orchestrating a fun and entertaining eveningLocated at the SW corner of 40th St and Campbell  This entire corner is now owned by an enterprising young couple who ingeniously converted the old post office to a wine bar featuring fresh aperitifs and lite gourmet pizza  They did such a fab job on the remodel they were written up in Architects Digest some 8 years ago or more when they opened  Its become something of a low key meeting hub with great date written all over the place  Any given night of the week you will find this place a buzz  So plan on a wait unless its early in the evening or very early in the week  like Monday  Open for lunch and open late again with some candied confections that could make a girl on a diet cry  Look cute because this is where the beautiful people hang out in Phoenix sans attitude  Moderately pricedThe organic vegetables are fresh The staff is niceBoxed Greens is located north east of Elliot and I 10 in Tempe Arizona  The entrance is located north of Todd Street on the east side of the building The entrance says Grove Commons  They need 24 hours notice for pick upsI learned very quickly that EmbroidMe is the place to get all your promotional items Brenda and Tim are always willing to show new products which in my world is VERY helpful They help you think outside of the box for your business providing AMAZING customer service Stop by and see what products EmbroidMe has for your business but also for any personalized gifts you want to give They are a one stop shopThey get the single star not for the doughnuts but because it was 112 degrees outside and they had no AC going in the restaurant It may have been hotter in the restaurant than outside it It was hard to order since I couldnt concentrate on anything but the heat I bought three doughnuts but couldnt ditsy to enjoy them because of the warmth I bought the chocolate Bismarck a raspberry jelly and some sort of crunch doughnut They were all good Too bad I had to enjoy them in the car of the Starbucks parking lot I will try them again hopefully in January when I wont care if its so hit inside the restaurantI must reiterate what an amazing place this is and how it is absolutely a staple not only to the NoDa area but the entire live music seen in Charlotte  I apologize for my quick review before but most of my write ups are about food so I was just straight to the pointSooooo much history here and more to be made  Many bluegrass legends such as Doc Waston Del McCourey and Acoustic Syndicate  Other genres such as Little Feet Rusted Root and even members of Crosby Sills and Nash have graced these doors  Too many too mention   There are many free shows quite often and its one of the biggest venues where you can still feel that intimate vibe from your favorite artists IMO  1000ish capacity Id sayFIRST OF ALLDont park in their parking lot unless your in a hurry there are plenty of free spots up and down the sidestreets of the areaAs soon as you walk up and see the marque you know the place is legit  Once you walk in the can see the side stage if open and a bar to your left always filled with friendly faces  There are plenty of good beers on tap4 for a stone IPA being my favorite at this cash only barFor most larger shows this side stage I speak of is rarely noticed and the dance floor for it is open for you to watch the main stage in the next room over  That is where the fun is  There is normally a dance floor open up front with seating behind it but when softer more singer songwriter type shows happen they pull out the seats for all  Another option is the balcony upstairswhich is full of seats is normally a great place to be because many that dont know the theater well dont know about it although it can get a little hot up there  The VIP section may be worth it to you as having a waitress is nice but youll pay a little more for the ticketThe place is nice but the talent they pull is amazing rarely if ever have I heard anything not at least listenable and except for a couple free acts everything Ive seen there has sounded great  This place normally has something going on all the time and coincides with the gallery crawls too  This is a piece of Charlotte that has to be witnessed read the calendar if you dont see anything you recognize read some reviews of the bands I have a feeling there is something there for almost everybody  At least go buy and check out the free arts market when it happensHope to see ya there Ill probably be the guy with a beer in his hand standing front rowVERY HAPPY My sisters and I came in on Sunday for manipedis Everyone was nice and engaging the whole timeI received a pedicure from Hugh sorry if I miss the spelling he was fantastic The only issue I had was the same with all the nail salons Ive gone to  its quiettoo quiet A stern look from the head librarian quiet Id prefer a little more client centered chatting IE the weather or the game or your boyfriend or whateverWorth every penny Its so nice to be able to swim without being out in the heat I have a pool and still go here a couple times a week Be careful with small kids though the waves pack a punchWho is flagging down all the onestar reviews for The Harmony Bar To anyone considering patronizing this establishment read the flagged reviewsGreat food at cheap pricesThey offer burgers wings ribs huge burritos salads sandwiches  wrapsTheir burgers and burritos are amazingIf your ever in the area check it outAre you kidding me Worst dining experience ever I had high expectations for this place First off the hostess was rude She asked if we had been there before but took awhile for her to explain how everything is selfserved which by the way was disgusting how all the meat and seafood is just openly exposed in the same nasty refrigerator for who knows how long The plates were dirty and some of the meat we chose from the fridge was literally sticking onto the plate No one even asked if we wanted anything to drink We had to get up ask for water It took 25 minutes to get our appetizers and the quality of the food was just horrible I had spit out the clams because it tasted old and bad I feel like Im about to get sick I left unhappy unsatisfied and still hungryI like this store for its products and its knowledgeable staff  I guess if I need smiles Ill go to a strip club as long as you keep giving them money theyll keep smilingMy guess is that Ruth K was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner  Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop run by someone with good business sense  What kind of a business only prepares food chickentuna salad hummus once a week  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge  Also whenever they lose an employee they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months  They should be open till 10 pm as it is with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood especially in the summer My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the placeBTW Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect but the place to this day reeks of stale smokeAdded note looks like my previous review was somehow deleted  Ill just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition I asked for a refund and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers That was the last straw  I wont spend another dollar thereWhat a great gardenBe sure to seeThe Thai PavillionThe ConservatoryThe Reflecting PoolGreat lighting great music great choreography I stayed at the Bellagio and found myself walking to S Vegas Blvd just to check out the fountain show If you enjoy the show check out the Fontana Bar inside of the Bellagio and request for outside seating trust me you wont be disappointedWe went to the Mens Wearhouse to outfit our wedding party with tuxes We worked with Jack who assisted us beyond our expectations It turned out that we could buy suits for all of the groomsmen for less than a tux rental would cost This meant that our wedding party got to keep their suits after the wedding and use them for business or other purposes  they were theirs Jack assisted us in picking out the perfect shirts and ties which we gifted to the groomsmen as our wedding gift I dont think we could have picked out anything ourselves that would have worked as well as what he helped us findEveryone looked great and the best part was that they got to walk away from the wedding with a brand new suit shirt and tie for less than the price that they would have spent to rent a tux And Ive returned a tux many times after being a part of a wedding party  often not a fun thing to do the morning after before you catch a flight out of townJack has continued to be a great resource alerting me to sales and helping me pick out whats best for my business attire even after wedding I used to be a solely Brooks Brothers guy when it comes to dress shirts mainly because I travel a lot and value the noniron shirts that BB offers I HATE ironing shirts But Jack introduced me to lines that Mens Wearhouse carries and the noniron shirts there are just as good if not better than those at Brooks Brothers Though a bit pricey at about 8595shirt normally Mens Wearhouse offers frequent 2 for 1 sales that make these shirts a bargain at 4247I cant speak about anyone other than Jack he seems to always be there but I cant recommend him or this store highly enough If you are looking to outfit your wedding party or just in need of some business clothes talk to him  he will take care of youThey are in fact the oldest coffee store in Pittsburgh being created in 1919 I wanted breakfastlunch and nothing was open in Market Square until 11am so this little place caught my eye They dont roast pack or warehouse their products but roast small batches of Arabican beans daily at optimum temperatures to insure peak flavor Upon walking in I was greeted with the scintillating waft of fresh coffee beans Tons of different flavors of Torani syrups also lined the walls making my decision even that much harder They had fancy lattes with turtle chocolate raspberry etc enticing names I decided to stick with one of their brews for the day Southern Pecan roast and had it just black It was quite delicious My sister just asked for a large coffee on ice Im not sure which roast she ended up with but the flavor was gone after she drenched it with milk and nasty saccharine Still delicious for an iced coffee but I cant deal with those people that like their coffee in milkshake form Upon leaving and inspecting the various bags of beans and teas I noticed this place also sells cigars Hot dog What a gemI love little soft serve places like this  The ice cream here gets an A  I had my classicsmall vanilla cone dipped in rainbow sprinkles  People were talking about their family memories from when theyd eaten here in summers past in lineIm not from the area but it seems to be somewhat of an institution  Just on our first stop we saw families of all ages couples bikerseveryone can enjoy this place  Definitely stop by if youre headed to the south sidei love lollicup  why cant one move to honolulu  they make the best peach iced tea ever  from now on whenever i go to vegas i will be sure to stop by lollicup and buy the biggest sized drinkHad flowers delivered to my girlfriend for Valentines day She works at a casino and I requested that they be delivered direct and they were delivered to the bell desk instead She was forced to leave her busy work to get the flowers herself The flowers delivered were NOTHING like what is shown on the website I could have spent half as much from a different florist for the same quality The flowers started to wilt after 1 day Very disappointed and will not use againGreat food and great service  I highly recommend going hereOne of the perks of living here is that we have a great Recreation Center called the R Club The R Club has numerous amenities from a resort style pool water slide park lap pool outdoor basketball tennis and beach volleyball Inside there is a decent gym with lots of cardio equipment free weights and cross training machines There is also an indoor basketball court and racquetball court For residents all of this is free of charge and as the other review stated for guests its a nominal 5 fee For such a large community Im actually surprised that more residentsguests dont use the Rec Center but I guess its a good thing so its not crowded all the timeThe wait was almost as bad at the food I felt so cheated after waiting to be seated just to eat this well below standard dim sumFirst time having Afternoon tea time in the States This place is very beautifully decorated We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZINGOk I have been to a lot of froyo places in Chicago the suburbs and even out of the states  Let me tell you nothing beats Cocomero  The best part about this place is that its selfserve with fresh variety of toppings  The design of this place is pretty nice it seemed like a picture out of an ikea catalog  I wish my University had this lucky for UofI students they can get it anytimeExcellent frozen yogurt huge selection of flavors and toppings  The best part is that it is selfserve so you can have as little or as much as you like as few or as many toppings etcEverything is sold by weight 047oz  A very reasonably sized bowl ended up being about 5I wish they had one of these in Ames IALong wait 45 mins for my table with reservation and 125hrs for food for subpar food on a Sunday morning I would have been fine with this wait if I had gotten the level of service and food I was expecting at The Avenue The quality and deliciousness of food has gone down since the new owners took over but the price has gone up Thank you to food fight for ruining a Madison staple for me There are too many better supper clubs awesome fish frys and amazing brunch places in Madison to waste my time here I wont be backThis place was great the rooms were clean and spacious the decor was modern and fresh the staff were all great and would bend over backwards to help anyway possible plus they had a free shuttle van to take you back and forth from the ball gamesMy wife booked my son and I for a fatherSon weekend to the GiantsPanthers game I had no idea a Holiday Inn could be so nice It offered everything the top hotels had in my years of traveling The decor room location were all 5 stars The front desk and valet parking were top notch I needed to charge my phone and iPad before the game and the valet brought my car down so we could sit and charge it After we were done he parked it again with a smileWe will absolutely be back Thank you for a wonderful stayThis was the most educational and fun activity on our trip to Arizona Our guide Caleb was incredibly knowledgeable about all things climbing We will use them every time we visit Arizona or their other  locations when traveling We laughed climbed and learned a lot At one point I became a little overwhelmed with the height and Caleb safely quickly verbally guided me down to where they were waiting at the bottom An amazing kind and very cost effective companyPay a lot Hope you love spicy foodWent here for wings and fish and chips The fish and chips are a whopping 15 but bizarre enough the wings ONLY come in an extra hot sauceWhyI left and didnt get either Some people are physically unable to tolerate super spicy foodsGet a clue guysIf youre a Devil Dog and visiting Las Vegas get off the strip and visit the Leatherneck Club  The moment you park your vehicle get out and observe the sign Marine Corps League Leatherneck Club you will feel right at home  As you enter you will observe the museum with artifacts dating back to World War I All donated from Marines and their family members  You never know who you will run into while there  I was fortunate to be there the same time as SSgt Tim Chambers aka THE Saluting Marine and a Korean War Veteran  What an inspiration they were  To the Marines who manage Leatherneck Club THANK YOU with all my heart  You all welcomed my family and I with open arms  Semper FiI took two of my friends there who are here in Phoenix the first time and the service was terrible  The noodles and other dishes were good as usual but the service we received from the guy was otherwiseThat guy talked very fast which didnt bother me as much until he started forgetting our requests  He stopped by to check if we needed to refill the green tea in couple of occassions but never did it until in much later time  When we asked to split the bills in two in certain way it had to be done three times  It just gave me the impression that he didnt really pay attention to what we wantedThis is the first time I went back since last year rated 45 previously  Hopefully he will improve his service and attitude or else they will lose more customersWe decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night  With the special they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a 50 voucher to that restaurant  When my husband called the Priory they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying  But the main issue was we checked in talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes and she set us up with the shuttle  We go in the room look around for the 50 voucher and its not in the room so we assumed i know we should never assume that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation  We had a fabulous dinner at MP great food great service and the bill comes  We asked the server about this Priory 50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didnt give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and hell work it out  We called the Priory and told them this the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it  Then refused to call MP to talk to the manager  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the 50 from our bill  It was embarrassing and it wasnt the issue with the money just the service with the priory  This showed us two things We wont be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to MP because their service was impeccableAfter a morning of Thrift Store hunting a friend and I were thinking of lunch and he suggested Emils after hed seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before and I had not He said they had a decent Reuben but to be prepared to step back in timeWell seeing as how Im kind of addicted to late 40s and early 50s and the whole Rat Pack scene stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burghas long as it doesnt involve 1979 which I can see all around me every dayAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burghwell thats like hunting the Holy Grail So looking under one more bush certainly wouldnt hurtSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle ofwhere exactly were we At first I thought we were lost driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway And thenAHA Here it is And yep there it was This little unassuming building with an addon entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply Emils We walked in the front door and entered another world Another time and another place Oh and any Big BurritoSousa foodies might as well stop reading now I wouldnt want to see you walk in roll your eyes and say ReaaaaaallllyThis is about as old world barloungerestaurant as it gets Plain with a dark wood bar on one side plain white walls with no yinzer pics good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker a fish sammich and some cheap scotch And THAT is exactly what I loveOhbut good food counts too We each had a Reuben and my friend had a side of fries The Reubens were decent but not NY awesome A little too thick on the bread but overall tasty and definitely filling Not too skimpy on the meat I seriously CRAVE a true good NY Reuben but since I cant afford to travel right now what I find in da burgh will have to do But as we sat and ate burgers came out to an adjoining table Those were some big thick burgers A steak went past for the table behind us That was HUGE And when we asked about it the waitress said Yeah its huge and really good and he only charges 1299 for it aint that nuts Another table of five came in and wham Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing Yeah I want that that that and THATMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm and that it is fantastic If only I could GET there on that week day before 4The waitress did a good job especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday and only one of her She kept up and was very friendly They only have Pepsi products so I had a brewed iced tea which was very fresh and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could As the lunch hour went on they were getting busyEmils is no frills good portions very reasonable prices VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wallkind of like Cheers but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950s Fanfreakintastic I could feel at home hereYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though I am not sure that I could find it again on my ownit really is a hidden gem I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it isAddendum 2nd visit for the fish sandwich Excellent Truly A pound of fish on a fishshaped bun as opposed to da burghs seemingly popular hamburger bun The fish was flavorful the batter excellent and for just 8 This may have been the best fish sandwich Ive yet to have in da burghThey were great and helpful  We had our youth soccer shirts done here They got the shirts to me on time and exactly how I wanted them to be Very affordable and would definitely recommend themI was on my way home and this was the last chance for milk tea before heading towards Mountains Edge  I already passed Chinatown and was too lazy to turn back  Ordered the milk green tea  worst milk green tea Ive ever had  No green tea taste what so ever and so so sweet  YUCK  It was premade and he basically just poured it out of a pitcher Saw it for myself I was so pissed at myself for picking this placedont you hate when you do that  I chucked the drink in the trash when I got home  Better off stopping at Starbucks for a grande latte for the price I paid for this disgusting milk green teaAnywaysThats what I get for being lazy and not driving back towards Chinatown for some REAL milk green tea  Oh welllesson learnedYelp failStrawberry boba Drink was so disgusting Too SweetNever againI went to this salon on Saturday 111911 because of a positive review on yelp but dont think Ill go to them again The atmosphere was extremely subdued the lighting was dim and the young lady I had was nice enough but you could tell she was not happy to be there plus she made comments to that effect They did not have a lot of choices in regular polish which were not organized 90 of the gels were glittered which btwhas chipped already My pedicure upon home inspection is poorly done with huge gaps and Im not in love with the colordidnt have much to choose from PS by monday 112811 i managed to peel off all my gel polishI am amazed at the quality and luxury of this place My 82 yr old mother moved in about 3 months ago and is the happiest Ive seen her in years Enjoying  the great living spaces wonderful staff and fabulous food she has made new friends and tells me about all the activities she is participating in  I wish I were old enough to get a plac e hereFinding a Family Doctor can be difficult and I have been having a rough time doing so since my former Doctor retired recently  The requirements I had were1  MD2  Office with one or two doctorsI hate when there are a bunch of people in the waiting room especially gross sick ones ugh3  Friendly staff that actually returns calls4  Doctor that doesnt make you feel rushed and listens to your issues5  Easy to access not in a big building that is hard to park in6  Available appointmentsDr Riley is all these things and more  Im  really happy with the ease and the great medical care  His nurses are good with needles as well  I had to get my blood taken and a few shots and she performed like a pro with confidenceSo if you are in need of a new Doctor I highly recommend Dr Riley  I think they also take most insurances as wellHOW HAS NO ONE REVIEWED THIS PLACE YETIts amazing We need more places like this in AmericaMy boyfriends parents wanted a gift card from here for Christmas so we made a stop while we were in town yesterdayAs mentioned previously ITS AMAZINGIm a vegetarian so the meat has no appeal to me but they had a ton of sausages sliced meats and even fish Their selection of cheese was also quite impressive What really was cool to me was the massive amounts of chocolate and European bakery mixes I had a hard time picking out what I wanted until I saw a box full of chocolate with a picture of kittens on it and it was called Katzenzungen Its so fun just to say Although I looked it up on the internet and the chocolates are supposed to look like cat tongueswhich is kinda weird but still super awesome at the same timeI will for sure stop in and visit Bavaria the next time I am in MadisonMy husband and I went to visit my nephew at Carnegie Mellon  It was our first time in Pittsburgh so we wanted something close to him  The Shadyside Inn was PERFECT for our stay  We are very very well traveled and are extremely selective about where we stay  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that we will be staying here again the next time we come back  In fact we tried but the dates we wanted were completely sold out The location is perfect and only a 5 minute walk from the shops and restaurants on Walnut Street  You dont even need a car  The Inn is a series of nicely renovated apartment buildings so they are all equipped with wellstocked kitchens my husband is a chef so he was very impressed by that  The front desk person was sweet and friendly  Not only did he check us in immediately he gave us a breakfast bag full of muffins juices and granola bars  Then he told us that he upgraded us to a suite even tho we only booked a studio   Well when we got into our room not only was it a suite but it was a 2 BR suite  I couldnt believe it  It was bigger than our apartment back home  Right then and there I wished we were staying longer  like a monthThe suite had a giant flat screen TV a big dining area with room service menu free wifi and super comfy furniture  The bed was to die for  The only thing that didnt go was the older unrenovated bathroom tiles  fixtures but it really didnt bother us at all because the shower water pressure was great  There is ample parking out back and the service people out taking care of the gardens and rooms were friendly and courteousWhen we checked out they were renovating the main office so its nice to see that they are constantly striving to update and improve  Checkout took less than 30 seconds  I handed her my key and they told me they would email me a copy of my bill since I used my credit card to book  Everything went so smoothly and the staff was so wonderful  We LOVED our stay here and would come back in a heartbeatI have no complaints  My brother and I were throwing a 50th Anniversary party for our parents and I was looking for some decorations  The woman who first helped me explained the pros and cons about paper vs plastic plates  Then another woman came to help and she said why dont I rent the plates  They are totally cheap and I got the white with gold rim china plates  I picked them up the day before the event and they loaded them in my trunk  When I dropped them off they took them out too  They come in a closed plastic banquet plate container and you dont have to wash them  To me I was being green as well as making it a very nice looking tableI have had quite a few items powder coated for my car from Snail Motorsports and have had nothing but a great experience and tons of complements from the work that was performed at this shop Pricing was every bit of what i paid for Quality and professional work and  I definitely recommend this shop to anyone and everyone who asks where a good place is to get this type of work done Oh my goodness  My husband and I have driven by here many many times but never thought it was open  Finally at the Local First festival we were treated to samples of their ohsofine sausage  You can taste the freshness in the incredible product that they put out  We decided to finally stop by because we were making homemade pizza for our annual Christmas Eve tradition and this time my husband and I were in charge and we wanted to make it special  We came in to buy Italian sausage and pepperoni but we were hard pressed not to leave with more  They sliced the pepperoni nice and thin exactly the way we wanted it and gave us a big giant string of weiners which I found hysterical  We opened the wrapped up pepperoni in the car and we had a really difficult time restraining ourselves from eating the whole thingBottom line if you want the freshest most delicious locally made sausages and other stuff like that you HAVE to go to SchreinersYukO I work just down the street and read the reviews so thought it would be great Wrong They gyro was ok but the salad that came with it was nasty wilted lettuce with a brown slice of tomato and a blob of dressing Their prices are too expensive for lunch and to top it off the girl working take out was totally snotty and rude when I asked some questions about the menu This one is a pass for meAlthough much farther away from my work or home than my previous doctor in Charlotte the extra drive to Northwest Family Physicians is always worth it if I leave on time and dont get caught behind any school buses on the way  Dr William Larsen was recommended to me and Im glad I switched my primary care to him  I receive such great care from Dr Larsen and I feel comfortable talking to him openly and honestly  Best of all he doesnt rush in and out of the room  He takes the time to sit and listen to you to understand everything that may be affecting your current symptoms  The staff has always been great too  Doctor appointments are usually lastminute things for me because Im dying or something and they can always get me in when its convenient for ME  I appreciate that and that says a lot about their serviceThis custom tailor  retail shop is classy and quality Fine selection of mens clothes shoes accessories knowledgeable highend tailors Would love to see how they can dress my manThis place is a joke My friend and I went in for gel services They let us choose from the templates Funny thing is neither one of us got what we paid for They did not match why even offer the templates We will never go backMuch more than just a card shop A very unique store Tons of pop culture stuff Take your time and look aroundMandana K Dave H and myself wandered around Mandalay looking for any bar to be open at 330 in the afternoon  We stumbled upon a statute of a beheaded Lenin signaling the entrance to the Red Square which didnt open until 4 PM  Once 4 arrived we were the first to walk into the bar that day taking seats at the bar which is made out of ice  Since this is a Russianthemed bar they stock a wide assortment of vodkas  On their menu they had pages and pages of specialty vodka drinks  We decided to each order different drinks so that we could sample each others  Since there were only a few other patrons we learned about the history of the place  When the bar first opened the bar generated a lot of controversy with the Russian community because of the statute of Lenin  head attached  and the perceived romantacizing of Communism  The bar caved  or maybe it was really a great publicity ploy  and decided to behead Lenin in a public ceremony  The head now resides inside a block of ice in the vodka locker a walkin subzero freezer that stores premium vodka for their clients its so cold that before you enter you need to don a thick russian like fur coat and hat  We toured the locker knocked back a shot of vodka and read the names of those who rented shelf space inside the locker  For several thousand dollars a year one can rent a space store any vodka you please have a name plate and enter the locker any time you please  Not a bad deal if split among the three of usWe continued to order drinks off the menu until we knocked back every single drink on the menu  We looked around  Just as we entered the bar as their first patrons we exited as their last  It was 4 AMWhile I was a little skeptical walking into the place I loved the experience in the end  EVERYTHING you need or could possibly ever think of needing is there in the shop in multiples  If you dont know what youre looking for or how to fix it Gerry will help you  As will the 6 other bike fanatics who are in the shop working on their own bikes  The prices cant be beat  And while you have to do the work yourself its really rewarding to walk out of there with a bike you fixed yourself  Same repairs at REI or Dicks would have been two to three times as much  Would definitely go back for moreYou know whats crazy Ive been to this sushi joint like at least 20 times and this is the first time Ive actually checked in I gotta step my game up Anyhow Godzilla Sushi Roll is the truth You cant go wrong ordering that Im seriously stuffed after eating I mean the crunchy tempura outside the savory sauce the fresh avocado The ingredients make love in my mouth Seriously In my opinion theres no need to try anything elseService is spot on Every time Im there everyone is very attentive and you cant beat the area I always find a spot to park on 3rd street and when its nice and warm out eating outside just makes it all worthwhile Even if I have to put quarters in the joint to park on a weekday Its worth it I go hard for some sushi especially the Godzilla roll Get on itHooray for the Vikings  Sure they might have looted and pillaged their way across Europe and spawned plenty of bad death metal bands but in the grand scheme of things thats pretty minor Why Because without a little genetic mutation spawned in Scandinavia that allows adults to continue consuming dairy all their lives Id have to avoid the amazing cheese section that Penn Mac has and would be stuck eating some funky soy based cheese or gasp having to do without and that would be a sad day indeedWith enough cheeses to make Wallace  Gromit happy you are bound to find what you are looking at Penn Mac   And if you dont know what you are looking for the cheesemongers are great in helping you find your wheyIf that was all Penn Mac had it would still be a required shopping destination but they have so much more  Their deli is just as amazing with the best Prosciutto di Parma you can buy  And If you cant find the olive oil or other Italian ingredients you need here then the only place you are going to find them is back in ItalyThe best little hidden gem in the city They have a classic jukebox bartenders that mix excellent drinks and tigers everywhere I love this place so much Just dont swearI heard about this guy Sarah K went out with on 1212 They didnt quite click but he sounded up my alley We totally hit it off and had all kinds of romantic dinners and wild nights Then we got married and made tons of babies and they all grew up to become supreme court justices This is how I feel about FateWhen Im feeling low and looking for a great atmosphere to cheer me this is where I go Great drinks and the staff is so very nice Throw a little karaoke in for fun and this is most definetly the place to beBest ballooning experience Ive ever had I had been on a sunrise ride a couple years ago with Hot Air Expeditions and decided it was a waste of my money and I never wanted to do it again Fast forwardmy boyfriend had never been on a ride so I decided to book us a flight I found Apex balloons and wasnt expecting to enjoy it after my first ride prior to this They blew my mind Apex balloons and their crew were so great Our pilot was Jon and our crew chief was Chad they were both very friendly outgoing people who made our experience so fun and special We were able to enjoy a private sunset flight and a nice champagne toast with the crew after It was a beautiful experience and Im so glad I found these guys I will be recommending this business to anyone that shows interest in ballooning Thanks guysWhen I lived in Chandler over 3 years ago I was a regular at this nail salon and loved it but then I moved to Cali  When I returned to AZ in October of 2011 I decided to go back to check them out they have moved and are even better than before  Nancy is awesome at eye lash extensions I have been to many places between Cali and AZ and Nancy by far does a fabulous job  Her technique is unique and she is a perfectionist Extensions can be pricey at first but well worth the investment The initial cost is approx 200 and I get refills every 2 weeks i no longer use mascara or eyeliner ans less makeup in general because my eyelashes compensate for it  I get compliments almost everyday on my lashes the length how naturally full they look and how beautiful my eye areGo see Nancy and let her work her magicThis place was unbelievable poor in regards to service I have yet to ever sit down in a busy restaurant for a lunch service read the menu choose a dish feed my 9 month daughter clean up and leave and not once have one staff member come by take our orderGotta give a big THANKS to this Walgreens  I found myself there shoeless with an overheated dog and they had no problem letting me come in with the dog to buy some water for him  It is rare for a big chain store to be so dog and barefoot friendlyVery unimpressed for dim sum on a Tuesday  Not very many carts with food Someone was carrying food but bypassed our table and went to other tables  We had to call them to our table  By the time the person came to our table there wasnt much selection  Service here is indifferent and lackluster  Many tables are just waiting for any carts  Definitely not worth coming her for dim sum especially on a Tuesday  This is the worst dim sum experience Ive ever had anywhere  Was here before for dinner and it was uneventfulI enjoyed this place in the 90s But I really dont see why it still exists Does anyone buy CDs anymore I can get any DVDBluRay I want on Ebay If I wanted tacky trinkets I could go to some place like Spencers in the mall or Red Hot Robot if I fancied myself cool Perhaps its time Zia faded away like the VCR or countless other  pieces of 20th century technologyThis is me n mumz second time here for Thanksgiving and they always make us feel like weve come home to family for the holidaysWonderful service and nice atmosphere for a holiday meal Speaking of which the food is like homemade too The smells and football on the TVs makes u feel at home Free Parking out front not too shabbyUnfortunately I had a really terrible experience at this salon I was excited to try a new place for a great price with a gel manicure groupon however when I got to the salon the lady redeemed my groupon on my phone and then immediately claimed no such thing happened I saw her press the button with my very eyes and genuinely thought this was a bad joke After I showed her she redeemed it she started arguing with me saying I need to pay again that my groupon was invalid and basically accusing me of stealing I was horrified She then proceeded to turn to  her coworkers and very obviously talk about me   It was the most appalling customer service I have ever seen She went on to make me pay full price for my manicure even though I had a legitimate groupon I would have left immediately had my friend who also had a groupon was not already inside My friend was serviced by a different gentleman and did not have any  problems She also simply showed her phone to the person pressed redeem and went on to get a manicure in peace We were both extremely appalled at their behavior and the terrible treatment of a new customer  I am never going backSaw Ballet Arizona performance of Giselle at Symphony Hall opening night last night and I have to say what a beautiful performance The music was perfect the story line was easy to follow I had received a program before it started but didnt look at it until intermission and I was able to keep up with everything that was going on  The dancers wow just beautiful to watch Thank you Ballet Arizona for the beautiful performance Look forward to seeing other productions in the future Excellent Michelin starred restaurant with friendly service and wonderful food Get a seat near the window where you can watch the chefs do their stuffTom Kitchin isnt afraid to be adventurous in his mixes of flavours which often delivers a whole new taste treat but on the rare occasion strikes an odd discordant note on the palateLocal produce always fresh especially fishCame from out of town for a trip to Fabulous Las Vegas and am a huge soccer fan After buying the new  USA away jersey at the Nike store at the Forum Shops the salesman highly hyped this place and for the USA vs Turkey game a new destination was high on my list I may have not calculated the time zone change correctly but showed up an hour and a half early for the game Wearing my new jersey an employee saw me and instead of offering me a place to sit or a drink to have while I waited I was greeted angrilyannoyingly by an employee who stated that you know kickoff doesnt start until eleven Rude and disrespectful Leaving I ended up watching the game at the Sporting House instead So much for trying a new placeI am not happy with Asia Tea HouseIt was a hot day and I was feeling optimistic So I decided to order a bubble tea I went with the mango fresh fruit Then the wait began  Fifteen minutes later the guy hands me my smoothie I took a sip This was followed by a frown Another sip was necessary to make sure I was not just imagining things Yep This was the worst smoothie I had ever tasted And I have had a lot of bubble teas in my day Forget the fresh fruit It was too watered down to be identified as a mango smoothie And the tapioca balls were tough and bland I had just paid 4 for water and crappy tapioca ballsThe search for good boba tea in Pittsburgh continuesWhat the hell Phils Tavern Every time I come here usually before a show things just dont work out I wanted them to but they just didntFOOD The only food Ive tried here were the jalapano poppers and then I never tried anything here again How do you burn something in a deep fryer Normally Id just be impressed but I was hungry DRINKS Their drink specials are nothing to write home about The dirty martini was weak and the tiny shrivelled Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress At least it was only 5 Unfortunately the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that 450 for a warm Corona Do not wantSERVICE Nice but few and far betweenATMOSPHERE Dank dirty sticky these are only a few of the descriptors for this place I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities hereOverall Dont waste your time and money I hear theres better places in this area I just need to find themThis gym is bright modern and clean the staff is friendly and helpful and they offer a nice variety of group exercise classes including CrossFit Its the perfect place to get in a quick workout on your own or try a classThe Gateway Village YMCA is small but Ive never seen it overly crowded Cardio machines and weights are on the main level with the locker rooms the group exercise rooms are downstairs Check the website for parking information I walk there but theres a free lot with access code in the evenings and they validate up to 2 hours in the garageWhen you walk out of Big Bang Bikes you know you are buying a bike that fits YOU  Glenn is amazing and he will help you reach your specific goals  He has amazing passion and knowledge to make you more efficient and comfortable  The best bike shopby far  Great prices and service  We live in the north and wont hesitate to make the extra drive for anything bike relatedThis is more than a bunch of batting cages  This is where you learn to hit  Wolfe is my sons instructor he is a natural coach you can tell he loves baseball and hitting  They have an area for soft toss tee and live pitching as well as machines  If  you have a membership its all available to you whenever you want not just during lessonsConsistently excellent  I enjoy their sushi and know when I get a chicken dish I dont have to guess if it is eatable always good white meat   I typically do take out and it is well worth the driveThis place is great The food is really quite good It has something for everyone For the not so adventurous eaters you can go with the yakitori or beef and for the very adventurous there are lots of options The hot pots are quite good We split a spicy beef and got items off the BBQ menu Our favorite was the cabbage SO good Also the beef yakitori and jalepenos were awesome with a sweet delicious sauce I definitely recommend trying this place outBack in January I had to have my gall bladder removed which was a very unexpected and scary surgery for someone like me who has only ever had my wisdom teeth out I was referred to Dr Tengs office by a friend of mine who had the weight loss surgery that is his bread and butter I should have waited for the doctor who I was referred to in the ER to have an opening but I was in a ton of pain and wanted to have the surgery as soon as possible It was no surprise that my liver was inflamed and that Dr Teng said it was the worst gall bladder case he has ever seen but at least he got it out and although I now have an 8 inch scar it was worth it to no longer be in the kind of pain I was experiencingI too had to pay a deposit before the surgery which I did and then six months after the surgery I received a sizable bill I couldnt understand why after the deposit and my insurance company pitching in he was still expecting me to pay almost 800 With the ER bills leading up to the surgery taxing our finances as well you can imagine I was not thrilled My husband tried calling the office at least three times to get the scoop on the bill When it came in the mail it looked sketchy with no actual descriptive information on it I could have designed a more legitimate looking invoice on my own computer We wanted to know what we were paying for exactly and why the balance was so much After three phone calls my husband had still not heard back from the office yet they continued to send out invoices threatening to slap us with a late payment Honestly who does not return phone calls If you are a business it is what you do We were very frustratedFinally my husband got ahold of Dr Tengs head secretary or office manager who seems to think very highly of herself She was very unhelpful and wouldnt answer his questions besides telling him to contact our insurance provider Again what kind of business practice is thisWe paid our bills and hopefully thats the end of itThe new office is awesomelove the mural on the back wall Everyone here is so niceFirst time here was Leather and Lace night in Oct 2009 Finally an adult place to have adult fun Not a bunch of college kids goofing around and giggling like fetish night at The Cardinal This was much more mature and so much fun Everyone friendly So many beautiful sexy people Loved the guy in the mesh shirt hee hee Ended up getting quite naughty and I cannot wait to return I thought it was much larger than I expected with the dance floor in the front the middle area bar and then the whole area in the back with two more bars thereFinally I have a place to go playKissy Sorry but the Red Square is not good anymore  The food is tired and poor quality  I had the worst lobster bisque in my life  The Calamari was icky and the main courses were even worse   They need a refresh I feel bad giving it a one star because our server was wonderfulI read a couple of the negative reviews but decided to get my Hugo Boss suit altered anyway I was lied to over charged I was given the wrong suit the jacket was not altered when I finally got the right one pants fabric bunched up where alterations were made and to top it off i was treated like it was no big deal I would avoid the guy if you have anything worth value Maybe okay for a pair of jeans or sweat pants No apology given after the mess There are too many professionals out there to go to who know what they are doing and who will treat you respectfully so dont go here Hopefully this helps youLoved everything from the ownership to the crowd to the live music LOVED how everyone seemed to actually be dancing and not just standing and staring on the side lines Did I mention that it was a live 10 person salsa band Yes yet another oxymoron salsa and snow Again Only in PittsburghYet another day with Mrs JulianneThis day was filled with once again s and some new itemsSomething New Please note that she is no longer located in room 9She has MOVED to room 15Sola Salons The district GVRThe room is larger and decorated lovely There is a pin up feel to this roomrisque pictures included  My first session a few months ago was a test strip testing two different solutions to see which one worked more effectively with my skin type and the mistakeI mean tattoo Once againI am warmly greeted by Julianne She had ran out to get an ultra soft blanket for my support and was still on timeOnce againBefore pulling out utensils Julianne examines the previously treated spot addresses my questionsconcerns Once againIt is all about ME My comfort and what would help make our session more productive Our first session had me on my side and this time I was on my stomach Julianne also gets me in the mood with musicmusic that I actually like No elevator or country music here  by my choice Im sure if you wanted country or classical she would pull up Pandora for youWhich she offered to do for meHow can I not get in the mood of tattoo removal when JayZ and Drake is on LOLSomething new She now has a comfort fishy Luckily I used her pinky fishy to have more support for my neckhead and fishy didnt have to soak up any of my tears something new The recliner is gone In its place is a new chair that reminds me of one at the dentists office In a faboosh SNAKE print of course Once againclean and sterile tools are open in front of me with Julianne putting on a fresh pair of gloves The products she used on me were fresh she mixed them in front of meThey havent been sitting around for hours or daysThe anticipation is almost worse than the actual pain We start with a numbing process and get to work Julianne takes my mind off the pain by having great conversation I dont think there was a thing that we DIDNT talk about todayhaha Which is awesome Who wants to sit in silence when youre getting needles dug into you and salt solution pumped inside you That would be awkward and painfulMy pictures are posted The letters that have a pinkpurple circle around them are almost invisible This is their second treatment The center looks like a big mass of sunscreen but that is a salt solution that we decided to leave on I would rather have a warm friendly consistent thoughtful professional quirky longer removal process than to have a quick solution and be treated like some cash cow number And Id rather not have my super fair skin burned up by a laser Well now that Ive confessed my strange love for JulianneMore updates and pictures to comeTHANKS AGAIN JULIANNE1062014It has been brought to my attention that Mrs Julianne has bought a laser and will have it up and running in December  Saline and laser tattoo removal will be offered Exciting Awesome place to go on a date Cheap and super cutesaw the austrailian pink floyd show 2 times and a doo wop show once place was built when everyone was 55 150 lbsi am 63 270 lbs so its a toyt squeese for a 2 hour concert but the sound and just the atmosphere makes me forget my knees are loc ated behind my ears red carpet on the walls makes me get all giddy betcha a cat would go ape in a place like this hope its open foreverI was in Vegas on business and had read this guys reviews  I could not believe someone would do this good of a massage for such little money but figured I might as well give it a try what else did I have to lose  Im a bodybuilder and try and get a good deep tissue at least once or twice a month  In short his work is nothing short of incredible  It was the toughest deep tissue work I ever had and the effects were long lasting  He is able to reach muscle attachments that no other therapist ever has  If you are looking for a terrific deep tissue man he is your guy  The place is nothing fancy he works out of his house in a clean private room behind it  He deserves all those starsMy son has been in attendance at MMAC for more than 5 years now and changes have certainly taken place within the organization  This dojo is deliberate in creating a balance between kata kumite sparring and basics  It is also set as a traditional Japanese dojo teaching Wado Ryu Karate  This is not a cutthroat plaza mall dojo like the Cobra Kai in Karate Kid that teaches students to harm each other and fight as a primary resource to resolving a physical confrontation  If you are looking for a fight club look elsewhereThat being said my son specializes in fighting here and does very well  He has participated in over 30 tournaments in AZ CA UT CO and NV  He has won several of these and usually medals at every event He is part of a competition team that takes extra time to train in fighting and competing  I am confident in his abilitiesThe dojo is restructuring and growing and all for the better  It has the best workshops training clinics guest speakers and REAL tournament training by far  I couldnt be more proud to recommend it to anyone looking for polished and professional traditional Japanese technique and practical selfdefense instructionBilly Ns review covers the details very well for the 4 Day Grand Prix course so I wont retype them One thing I will add is that the drills in the first two days are applicable to both the rest of the course and street driving so they are definitely worth the time spent on themFrom my experience with the heat on the track dont hesitate to take a break when you need one there is plenty of seat time in the courseFrom the moment you walk in until the moment you leave everyone is professional and relaxed to make sure you have a good time and learn all you can  Thanks to Brennan Instructors William and Robert Marissa at the desk and of course Bob Bondurant for executing a great week for me and the rest of our classUngood I went in for a follow up brow wax 1st one wShar was ok No big complaints no rave reviews My 2nd encounter wShar was a brow cleanup  then I got talked into a facial Bad MoveShar was pretty condescending  didnt particularly provide a relaxing atmosphere But the worst was my facial was interrupted by the front desk girl Shar excused herself came back a few minutes later very apologetically telling me all the supplies were in the room we were in She gathered a few things continued to apologize  assured me shed be right back  Ten mins later the front desk girl came in to offer me water  apologize for Shars absence she also assured me Shar would be back within two minutes Fifteen minutes after that with no sign of Shar returning I gathered my things  left  I was clear that I would not be paying for a facial that was not complete  the front desk girl was apologetic  polite She also offered me a free facial the next time I came in I politely informed her that I would NEVER be coming back Bottom line go elsewhereMy aunt was visiting from Chicago and booked a room at the Inn after the Vanlandingham estate which is a sister business to the Morehead Inn said they were fullWhen I dropped her off I went inside to check it out and Im glad I did  Its truly an amazing house   Walking around the place you can really start to feel as if youve gone back in time  I only saw one guest room but it was impressive  very well appointed with antique furniture it had a separate sitting room with its own couch and the views were of the thick stand of trees to the east and south of the houseI also really liked the enclosure of live australian finches downstairs  Theyre colorful lively things to watch and I was told that sometimes the cat they keep around the house just sits around staring at the birdsAnyway if youve got guest coming from out of town who are into antique and ornate surroundings they would do well to stay at the Morehead InnIs it just me or do restaurants in Montreal just like to take their sweet timeArriving after 8 with a party of 12 we were told that it was a busy night but things shouldnt be much later than usual fair enoughAfter our server skipped passed us many many times assuming that we were waiting for some people when we had told him we werent waiting we put in our foodI ordered a green salad  6 and there was NOTHING in it except greens that seemed like it had come from a boxed salad from Costco I had asked for a large portion but he indicated that it was quite big forming  a ball Too bad this ball was pretty much full of air as the greens had no extras  cucumber onion tomato JUST GREENSWhile our table was split into 2 groups of 6 the consistency of service was terrible Table 1 got appies and approximately 5 minutes after table 2s main course had come out which is understandable because they mustve been super hungry probably after 9 As we were finish our appies our server said that he didnt want to rush us and asked if we would like our main courses to be put in We were so hungry  of course yes We thought he was going to bring out our main courses but NO he had not even punched the order into the kitchen yet  it was probably another 40 minutes before Table 1s mains came out and by then Table 2 is already eating dessert We were so hungry to the point that we were not even hungry anymore When we called the waiter over he looked so nervous and had no answers for us as he hurried back into the kitchen in the hopes to get us something to eat let me say that all our food options were either raw rare or lightly seared Not sure what took so longThe mains came out probably 1030 We were not hungry anymore My salmon tartare with avocado and lemon oil was sub par It was 2 3 avocado puree and the lemon oil tasted like water Although other people thought the food was good I could have really had a good meal elsewhere without the wait timeNot going to write anymore Theres nothing more to say The thought of thinking about this makes me sadAfter a lengthy stay in the ICU my mom was brought here and spent three weeks  We visited  a couple nursing homes but the one we selected couldnt take her  She was brought here but we were a little anxious after seeing it only had 25 stars    This place far exceeded our expectations  Its the only nursing home we went to that didnt smell like pee and poop  The rooms are comparable to a nice hotel VERY clean  She enjoyed the food  And most of the residents seemed to be in good spirits which to us says a lot  The nursing staff was fantastic  She especially enjoyed her time with Ian her speech therapist  Physical therapy team did wonders  She spent a month in the ICU sedated for 2 weeks on a feeding tube and suffered ICU phycosis before she was brought to freedom plaza care center  They had her up and walking and taking care of herself in a few short daysTHANK YOU Freedom plaza care center staff for giving us back our momFood is good but the bartender Stephanie is rude and ignores customers but caters to the regulars  it seems like she hates her job and is miserable  poor management and not so friendly employees   I called and left a message to speak to Christo or wife Gloria but of course manager intercepted the message so I never received a call back from either  I hope that Christo would read  these reviews him self so he knows what goes on when hes not around  I will never return or refer anyone and will make sure to let everyone know how rude u employees are specially bartender StephanieYou want style  You want selection  You want clothes that have been respectfully honored for the wearable vintage art they are  Go here  The owner Richard is topnotch and knows his stuff inside and out   My only regret is that I didnt have more days to visitmaybe that good thing because honestly I dont think I would have left the store  If I lived in Pittsburgh Id be making weekly maybe even daily journeys to the storeIm an experienced vintage shopper and baby  it doesnt get better than this  And the prices  very reasonable for the quality of the clothing which is all cleaned and tenderly lovedMmmmmKorean Spicy Beef at its finest Their appetizer breads are fantastic as wellThis guy altered a pair of my jeans and a fancy dress of mine and both items came out PERFECTQuick turn around time tooLove itGreedy monks All I can sayRequires a minimum of 50 per person for donations On major holidays they wont even supply plates and utensils for the people to eat the food They YELL at you I grabbed a paper plate from somewhere and this woman snatched it back and gave me a stink eye Monks are always seen at casinos gambling I used to work at Coach Inc purse store they would go in and shop all the time Now I saw them at apple buying 2 iPads with our donation money Screw this corrupt place and their corrupted monks They dont even follow the rules of Buddhism This place is a jokeFunny about Lohan SchoolI went there from a suggestion of a friend of mine This place is run by Sifu Steven Baugh and I knew that nameit turned out Sifu my friend in Jr High Schools dad Raul teaches there as well Its a very welcoming environment People there are friendly and teach many aspects of Kung Fu Lohan is a non profit school which made it very appealing because they werent trying to sell me a 200 dollar outfit or buy weapons in the black market I loved going to the Spiritual Warrior classes The community service they do is very admireable Ive seen them on Fox 11 news and doing lion dances during Chinese New Year they have been to clubs to ward off the evil spirits and promote prosperity and health I think Sifu is a great spiritual and community leader This will be good for kids to help build their self esteem and get in shape for the great war with the Outlandersuh whoops this isnt Mortal KombatYum yum yum LaTorres is one of my favorite lunch spots and Id highly recommend it to anyone who hasnt been  My personal fave is the Pollo Chipotle sandwich with skinny fries  Their food is amazing and the prices arent too bad eitherI have a slight issue with LaTorres and here it is  Once upon a time I asked for the Cubano sandwich but with NO mustard  Well Mr Waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are premade and they are unable to alter them in any way  Hmmpremade hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine  Im a skeptic  After asking around I found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are NOT premade but the managerschefs say that so that they dont get overwhelmed with nitpicky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush  My point  the next time you want your Cubano with no mustard or extra sauce dont believe the hype and make them customize it for you  By the way my spy happens to be an employee so I know its true  All in all this place is greatIve actually had OK experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad I tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district  bad move  Upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitarysounding Klassy For reasons I truly cant explain we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination We both threw down a brew nasty paid and left Unfortunately for Olive or Twist the visit would probably be our lastOn a positive note there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set His warmup sounded good but we left before he really got started When its all said and done we should have just went to the Sharp Edge down the street Probably a much safer bet for future endeavorsIf you have any common sense at all please dont stay here  Once it almost burnt downand Im pretty sure most of the locals were chanting burn baby burnYummy Pupusas  I still cant get them to come out right at home so I go hereDuring my recent visit to Pittsburgh I lived like a baron in the Mr Boggs Suite while staying with friends Karl Kargle and his partner in life and business Jeffrey Stasko at the former Boggs Mansion beautifully restored and now called The Inn on the Mexican War Streets Once the town home of financier and department store baron Russell H Boggs now its an elegant Bed  Breakfast  rich in character with guest rooms that are as charmingly unique as their new proprietersMy enormous room

massage He knows exactly what to do and what to fix when I am hurting I always get  the 90 minute massage and when its over Im like already  LOLEveryone please let this man massage you You cant go wrong with that great discounted price  AMediocre service COLD food Our food waited so long the lettuce  pickles wilted Bland food Crazy overpriced Long waits in the arcade 1 beer per hour maximum  Avoid at all costs Fair managerBest public course in Phoenix in my opinion   Every hole is picturesque and feels like what desert golf should be penalties for missing but not so narrow that you have to hit an iron off every tee  The elevation changes make the course a joy to play and has been in great shape every time Ive played it   The only annoyance is the drive in the cart from the club house to the first tee  Cool factor for having a gold simulator in the bar nowI go there as a tradition with my best friend when she comes home and its one of my favorite places The resteraunt is quiet and low lit so its very relaxing Service is quick and friendly The lunch specials are amazing deals and theres enough variety there that I never get bored with the choices Their tempura is the best ive ever had and the rest of their food is just as amazing Their ginger dressing makes me want to drink it straight Even thinking about it has set me droolingProbably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon that we had purchased specifically for Fujo They refused to take it and the manager told us you have two choices ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it If we had been rude then I wouldnt be able to blame him but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it We walked out and went to Emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent foodOh puhleaze  The good reviews must be written about excellent headliners or by shills  Got supposedly free tickets that cost the three of us 40  They included one watered down drink each  Yes even my bottled water that is clearly labeled 4 cost 1050 plus a 250 upcharge plus tax plus whatever else it took to get to the 40  The MC was horrible and I never heard so many genitalia jokes in a 60 minute period before from three different comics  If you go take lots of money and buy lots of drinks because the only people laughing were drunk drunk drunk  The venue is very mediocre and as might be expected in Vegas you have to walk through the casino to get to it  Showtickets4locals sure was a rip off on this occasion  Never used them before and never will againOne word Chernobyl   Start your night with this cocktail  Whether you have to beg borrow or video poker your way to the bargain 12 that this thing costsDO IT  If you like vodka in my case LOVE vodka or even if you dont this is the cocktail to end all cocktails Its got something close to 5 shots in it plus a float of stoli elite 5 different kinds of vodka  But it gets betterthe drink doesnt taste like vodka  It tastes like a delectable cranberrylimefizzy thing that wont give you so much as a buzz  It comes with a mutantlooking candie cinnimon stick thats a great touch  Well worth it  Its a vegas musthave  Other than the drink the bar is nifty great decor former USSR the outfront statues head inside the frezzer and bartops of ice  Food is great but EXPENSIVE The other drinks are great tooand I think theyre fairly priced for the selection of vodkas strength of drink and originalityOne of the BEST Asian restaurants in Charlotte hands down I was shocked it was not already on YelpThey specialize in Malasian Food but offer a fusion of Japanese sushi  hibachi Chinese and Thai inspired dishes Honestly I have not tried the Hibachi but the sushi is among the best even over sushi specific restaurantsDont be scared of the term Malasian if you are not familiar with it There is not a single person I have ever taken there that has not loved it and become a regular patron Even the standard Chinese Restaurant dishes are really good Kung Pao Chicken or Shrimp Chow Fun and fried rice Try the Roti Telur for an appetizer Its a savory Curry Broth with potatoes dont think of Indian Curry its mild and I think it tastes similar to Thai Massaman curry Comes with homemade bread pancakes for dipping Also the Beef Satay is very goodThe wait staff is usually very helpful to new customers that are not familiar with the dishesThey do a great Lunch Menu and are very fast with serviceLocated next to CPCC campus downtown this place is a must tryIve had a big change of opinion after spending more time in that gym The equipment would often break down and never get fixed Considering how small the gym is its inexcusable that two treadmills would be out of service for at least a month I also had problems with the individual TVs on machines sometimes they wouldnt work properly or would be completely brokenThe gym was generally quiet enough in the mornings but it would be pretty packed after work It was hard to find a machine The staff also didnt really enforce the 30 min timelimit policy which caused people to have to wait for equipment longer than necessaryI was told on the phone I needed to let them know before the 25th of a given month to cancel my membership moving forward and not be charged for the next month I wasnt told that I had to give 30 days notice aka pay for an extra month Though theyre technically right it IS in the contract I feel that their staff mislead meIf you live in Shadyside or nearby GO TO URBAN ACTIVE INSTEAD Its cheaper and the facilities are unbelievably better than XShadyside although I apparently have a membership at XShadyside for another month now I am 100 done with that placeThis is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests  It never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt  Always fresh always funny  Great place for a date night or family night  Even my teenagers love it  I never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly  To finish off the night head down the street to The Sugar Bowl for fresh ice creamLove this place Great sushi and have great sushi specials at lunch and HH Bartenders are the best also Marty is the manThough Jessie Browns isnt in the most accessible or likely location it is easily one of my favorite places to buy gear and apparel Ive been coming here for the past couple of years and have always found items that were difficult to come by deals that couldnt be resisted and always helpful staff Though some of the gentlemen tend to have a bit of an attitude they are always willing to help you find what youre looking for The layout and decor is really welcoming and has a great feel These guys have a great selection from different brands North Face Arcteryx Patagonia Marmot and some others I also really dig that they have a good selection of climbing shoes and gear Their shoe selection is always packed with all different levels of outdoor need Ive never purchased one from these guys but they have a killer selection of knives too In the past couple of years Ive purchased plenty of MSR camp stove canisters from these guys They always have a plethora Also picked up a nice Thermarest from here Most recently my wife and I were looking for a nice midlayer jacket for the winter for her We checked out a few different options in the womens section and ended up scoring a great deal on a hooded zip from Patagonia It was on crazy sale too Dont remember exactly how much we ended up paying but I know it was close to 60 off from the previous year If Im ever looking for something particular Jessie Browns always has it or at least something comparable Love coming to this local shopUmmm DriveThru boba How can this be a BAD thing Well it just so happens that it CANT Thai Iced Tea Taro and Honeydew too This place is the BEST The lady who runs the counter is VERY nice and the donuts are delicious Stopped in for a Honeydew melon boba and a ham and cheese croissant and my kids spent the next hour munching quietly on donut holes which was just a reward in itself The prices are cheap the service is friendly and I will take BoSa over Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts ANY day of the week Also an FYI ignore the BoSa website  this location does NOT serve kolaches and they have their own hours which I believe are 5am10pm every dayThis is by far the classiest thing in Las VegasAnd its free I would probably pay to see this but Im glad that I dont have toThis is a true phoenix treasure The two sisters are very helpful pleasant and businesslike Sometimes when they have meat just out of the smoker they will offer a sample or theyll toss in an end chub wrapped into your bagit seems like they know youre going to rip into one of the other packages if they dont Come with cash  chose practically anythingsandwich meat sausages or the uber yummy beercase cheese  Every time in there are usually some Europeans shopping there which also validates the legitimacy of this fine establishmentRhiannon performs amazing feats on my fine hair and is able to accommodate to any stylecutcolor I throw at her  but not without making sure its what I really want She explains how a cut could work or not work for your face typelifestyle etc and really takes the time to listen Shes both professional and personable and I wouldnt want anyone else to fix my hair woes but herOn my drunken conquest to visit my very first all nude strip club our cab driver suggested this place We pulled into the parking lot saddled up with our driver and at 545am we were told the place was closing at 6am and that they were not allowing any more clients for the evening BOOWhether it is Art Walk or just any day I love shopping or looking at the galleries in Downtown Scottsdale I cannot yet say I have even been to most of them because there are so many All of the galleries I have been to have been really cool with amazing one of a kind pieces All of the owners have been very nice to me which is cool I guess I have this stereotype that all people who work in galleries will see Im young and cant afford anything and will be snooty to me Not the case though Great way to kill a day and really fun to do the art walk at night which has a great energyOllie the TrolleyFreeI wish I had made it out to this place on my last trip to Charlotte Pretty much all of the other music venues I wanted to visit reserve their acts for Friday and Saturday nights especially on a holiday weekend like Thanksgiving However Im more of a middleoftheweek music appreciator For other Monday night music lovers this is an excellent place to take a visitor for some straight ahead jazz and blues I used to love standing in line in the cold to see jazz played the way its meant to be played in a smoky basement with singers and musicians jumping on the mic at completely unscheduled times at a little club called Smalls in Manhattans West Village And the ability to enjoy some of the best Rockabilly Country and Blues musicians around for FREE at Rodeo Bar in Manhattans Murray Hill any night of the week has also spoiled meMy point being  places like Smalls Rodeo Bar and Double Door Inn are a dying breed It is your duty as a live music supporter to exercise your right to enjoy this craft in a setting that is up close and personal and velvetropefree Though I doubt that the Double Door can draw New York sized crowds on a school night if you bring a group of friends here now it could quickly become your own private corner of musical heaven for years to comeWell I think Heidi S pretty much covered all of the bases here The lemonginger tea that I ordered was weak perhaps not steeped hot enough The hummus wow definitely the worst tasted like paste Yuck with a capital whY I considered giving two stars because the service and atmosphere were pleasant but since I do not plan to return I guess methinks not5 Stars all the way Front desk attendant Christian went above and beyond the call of duty He has a great attitude and is very personable He is an asset the the Holiday Inn brand We were grieving the loss of loved one and he was completely compassionate We can tell he loves his job  I will always stay at Holiday Inns for now onThe place had this awful smell to it wasnt sure what it was but smelled something like dirty clothes that have been wet a few day The prices are high at most the vendors stands that I went to There is no food that I seen so if your hungry this isnt the place to come Once you smell the inside you will most likely lose your appetite anyway The management is rude and dont speak much english or any spanish When asked a question they simply ignore you or say the dont understand I will not be returning because there was nothing that was of any use to me I will stick to the Arizona Mills good prices and AC something the indoor swap meet didnt have runningCharlottes hidden gem located near NoDa Stop in and see Karisa owner of Nectar florist The history of the garden is amazing It feels like you have stepped out of Charlotte and into a fairytale I had my wedding there and I highly recommend it to everyone else too Open minded to everyone and all ages If you are from out of town go here Take a camera Art flowers train car its gorgeous Their events are so much fun too Mothers day always has something sweet going onGo see this special placeLove this spot Great food easy going setting Come as you are Owner is super sweet Been here nearly a dozen times and it is consistently good YumExcellent service and repair  Completely explained how to adjust and take care of our Grandfather clock on our own  Would recommend to othersCant wait to see them destroy the Red Wings over the next 10 yearsArlo Guthrie Henry Rollins Toots and the Maytals are just a few of the bands on the line up this month Its a great place to see a band and they have good beers on tap tooTonight was the grand opening andthey nailed it  SERVICE A DECORE ADRINK STRENGTH  ATIME TO GET IN C with being on the list w a table but with all the other Asit was worth itThey have a girlsguys bathroom with a bar in it that is one of the coolest things I have ever seen and music that is bumpin  We even ordered some food to munch on and it was DELICIOUS we got the tuna tartar a chicken salad and some pork stick things that were great portions and very tasty  Plus the service never faltered and was super impassive for being PACKED and opening nightAll in allI was IMPRESSED and for SURE going back1 burger night on Tuesday Add ons moreI love my doctors  They are so respectful  I went in today with serious pain  My main doctors partner saw me as my primary doc was out of town  She introduced herself asked me a lot of questions about my symptoms examined me and made several recommendations  Surprisingly one of them was to see a chiropractor for an evaluation as the problem seemed to be with the muscles and bones of my ribcage  Dr Mansfield prescribed some lowkey meds ibuprofen and a muscle relaxer and referred me to an awesome chiropractor right next door  I got the best nights sleep in recent memory and the pain seems to have decreased some already  The office staff is courteous and efficient  I hated to leave my old doctor who Id seen for many years but she moved her office way out to southeast Gilbert  Mountain View is just a few miles from my office  Im glad I made the changeWorst service ever So the boyfriend and I were at Town Square on a Friday afternoon We were really really thirsty I suggested we go to Lollicup to get some kind of flavored iced tea There was no one in line as my boyfriend and I were making our way to the order window However another couple got there right before us so we got in line behind them There were 3 girls working so we didnt think it would be that long of a wait with only 2 people before us and no one around waiting for their drinks This was definitely not the case The couple before us apparently knew one of the girls that was working there and proceeded to have a personal conversation for several minutes without even ordering anything We ended up just leaving for the clear disregard the workers had for their customersNEVER again will I try to order a drink from here Ill just wait until I go to Florida to get my Lollicup fixItalian dinners American endless soup and salad bar is great Most food for your dollar I highly recommend Great bar Good place to watch a game The bar can get quite noisy in the evenings but it adds to the great atmosphere at RockysThis is only for bobaMy friend told me this place has really good ice cream but I was craving for boba tea so I bought taro tea with boba When I first took a sip the taro flavor was vague and didnt have enough taro flavor in a taro tea and the bobas were very hard and not fresh LIke come on I wanted taro not like a watery purple drink  I took few sips and threw it away because it was disgusting They seriously need improvement on their flavor or the powder they use If you are going here for Taro try somewhere else if you are going here for boba dont waste your moneyNever seen something so useless in my life A bunch of small stores with no good things Smells weird and there isnt even a lot of stores to be honest Everyone looks like they dont wanna be there which sucks Place isnt good at all Dont waste your Money on junkThis boba place make my Jasmine Milk Tea like no other I live 15 minute away from Easy Life Boba Tea but if I get the craving then I will do what it takes to get to this heavenly place Its just that UBERSUPERWONDERFULLYDELICIOUS So worth my hard earn cash and gas so worth it PERIODPS This is one of the rare boba shop that accept debit cards WoaaahThe 2 reasons I originally went to AZR were 1 My hubby bf  the time was way into climbing so we started climbing together and 2 One of my good friends works there idk if he still does but he worked there FOREVER  I was immediately hooked on climbing AZR is a great place for kid parties and team building they probably have at least one kid birthday party every weekend  They have plenty of bouldering and trad routes for people of all skill levels They even have lead climbing and classes to teach you lead climbing if you dont know howwhich I dont haha  The staff is super cool here and we got on a first name basis with them They are always friendly and helpful and fun to hang out with lol  I also loved the free yoga classes for gym members with Jeanette  I miss this place so much after moving awayFree samples of cheese cheese spreads and fudge As good as it gets I love this place We bought about 15 worth of cheese after being pampered and trying about 10 different types of cheese 5 types of cheese spreads and 2 types of fudge The store has tons of Wisconsin favorites which I suppose is in part of attracting tourists to think that they are purchasing purely Wisconsin delicaciesThis is a true neighborhood bar  Quaint divey but great atmosphere  Friendly staff cheap beer with some decent varieties on tap  Since its relatively small its nice that its an over 21 crowd  Great location a campus town secretVegetarians need not apply the only salad you will find here is a pile of grilled onions  Seriously this place is comfort food heaven  I ordered a chicken sandwich a large cevapi which I can only think means delicious spicy meat fingers in Bosnian sandwich a cheese pita and a spinach pita  I cant really put my finger on what makes the food so good other than its straight up comfort food that sticks to your ribs and makes you wish all pants came with elastic waistbandsThe restaurant itself is out of this world no seriously its like walking into some small Bosnian holeinthewall  What it lacks in amenities it makes up in character youve got soccer playing on the TV and this 70s eastern European techno playing in the background while a bunch of men chat away in the back of the shop  The best way to describe it is Star Wars Cantina scene meets National Geographic  Dont worry about feeling like an outsider nobody pays attention to the confused and worried look on your face unless its the gracious and friendly host  Anyway back to the food  The chicken sandwich was perfectly seasoned and cooked while the meaty Bosnian sausages put Jimmy Dean and his family to shame  I recommend using the Kobayashi method on these dishes meat first bread second  Oh and dont forget to ask for some ajvar tart redpepper sauce to dress your sausages with  The bread shouldnt be ignored though since it is thick rich and hearty  The pitas are not pitas in the MiddleEasternGreek sense theyre more like stuffed fillo pies and theyre just as delicious as the rest of the entrees  By the way the portions are quite large and make a Hungry Man frozen dinner look and taste like a McDs Happy Meal  Actually if McD could make their McNuggets even remotely taste like Sarajevos cevapi they would rule the worldIn all seriousness though this is simply awesome comfort food at an uber affordable price  Although I must admit that I was so in love with my plate that I may have snarled and showed my teeth to innocent bystanders who got too close  Regardless I definitely recommend this place if you want to try something as Cheech and Chong would say thats the same as your favorite comfort food but different  I would write more but the food coma has completely taken me overPost Scriptum  I believe my stomach just did a happy dance and passed outService wasnt that great and the bouncer had a real attitude with people It was my birthday weekend and I thought this place would be a cool place to have it Yeahnot so much I was really disappointed with his customer service and peoples attitudes It was suppose to be a cheery event so we went to prime bar and salt turned out to be a great night after we left this placeI was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizersI am giving it one star though it deserves none because our waitress was nice if a bit inattentive and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desiredThis is probably the first place Ive been to where they charge 10 and up for all mixed drinks To me that is beyond ridiculous Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant as much as they wish they were and paying almost 60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined As I mentioned the waitress was friendly but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good but if it want to spend that kind of money Ill go somewhere that I can get good serviceOne of my favorite sandwich places since the early 80sits my NOONER stop any time I am downtown Phoenix or at the Town and Country areabread so fresh and such tasty sandwiches for all tastesI dont know why its such a hit or miss thing with flowers I ordered a dozen roses from the rose shack for my wife for valentines day They told me they get fresh roses on Monday So I figure Ill have them delivered Tuesday that way theyll be fresh and she can enjoy them all week However this was not meant to be 130 dollars later and Thursday shes already throwing some out Ive ordered before and got nice flowers I dont know why its so inconsistent but Im done Ill find something else to do on valentines dayDANGERDANGER ZERO CONCERN FOR CLIENT SAFETY State board needs to be warned of this place This place deserves negative stars They burned the top and side of my foot with callous remover I have abrasions on my foot that are still there a week later I am unable to wear shoes or even flip flops because of the pain The side of my foot also blistered up They use unsafe practices and then tried to blame me for having sensitive skin I went to nail school and have used various callous removers safely on myself and others I do not have sensitive skinFirst and foremost wheres the dance floor Service was pretty fast with getting me drinks but the quality of the drinks was terrible Vodka cranberry tasted like something with cranberry syrup and the bartender gave me an attitude about how its not his fault so it must be minePacked with zombies in dresscode uniform and a long line Revolver would have been a much better idea and it doesnt have a coverHOLY CRAP THIS PLACE IS AWESOMEFood wine service even the French staff  all fantasticDid the tasting menu with matching wine and we were happily stuffed full of food and rolled to a waiting taxi after meeting Tom at the end of the night Small things like a map from where in the country produce was sourced and a copy of the tasting menu itself were nice little touches which werent required but definitely welcomedDefinitely coming backMin has been doing permanent makeup for something around 30 years I got my eyebrows done by her about a year agoPros Min is very experienced   Permanent makeup comes with 5 free appointments for touch ups  Competitive prices Rooms are clean  Variety of services offered Friendly and helpful staffConsultbefore the tattooing An assistant draws in the shape you want with an eyeliner pencil I did have some doubt right before I got my brows done My natural eyebrows were very thin and each were very different in shape length etc and its always been difficult to draw them on evenly But the assistant was very patient and helpful and spent probably half an hour making my eyebrows the shape I wanted them Getting them tattooed Min having been doing this for so long is confident in what she does so she does move a little fast But be assured she knows exactly what shes doing I told her I was still a little unsure of the shape of my right brow but she said not to worry she would fix it and she picked a color that would look good on me Obviously when youre about to have something tattooed onto your face you want to be 100 sure about everything before you start I had a little doubt about the shape of the right brow and if the color was too dark but I couldnt be more happy with the results My brows look very natural and people are surprised when I tell them theyre tattooed because of how subtle and natural they are OVERALL Would recommend Experienced and friendly Great prices Im very happy with my permanent eyebrowsInitially it was a bit scary to me but once I got used to being up in the air it was a breeze pun not intended  I booked the flight for myself and hubs and for a moment it looked as if it wasnt going to happen due to rain coming into Phoenix  Of all the times  We were called and asked if we wanted to change the date but we couldnt so it was left to see if the original date and weather would cooperate  They didKevin is a hoot which made for a great ride  Very professional but also fun which helped when I was still nervous  He explained many things about ballooning and its history and what things we were floating over beware the jumping cholla cactus and even told us there was an app for wind currents which proves there is an app for every thing Our ride was a sunrise one and it was amazing to see the sun come over the mountains and watch the other balloons that were also flying that day to inflate and rise But our ride rocked as his will only carry up to 4 people plus him unlike the others which looked like egg crates full of people  they can carry up to 14 at a time some of them As it turned out it was just us and Kevin so it was fantastic  Seeing the world from 5000 feet in the air in a basket is something else  If you want an experience to cross off your Bucket List or for a special occasion  I highly recommend Kevin  You will not regret it and like me will want to do it againFolks this is your quintessential small town concert venue  Great prices great service great music  I came from way out of town for an act that I couldnt pass up the Corb Lund Band  Canadian HonkyTonk at its finest  What I like most was the vibes  this place has character  You can tell the building is old but from what it looks like it is in great condition  The mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retromodern twist  I like it  If its open try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony especially if seats are limited down below  The view and sound is fantasticTicket prices are right on the mark  most shows that I saw are under 20 most well below that  Corb was 15 and from the performance we got Id say it was well worth it  What also blew me away was the drink prices I got an above rail whiskey mixer for under 5  Maybe Im not used to small town prices but this was an unexpected surpriseAll towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like The Highdive  I have to agree with Jess S on her review there are not many places like this in the Midwest and surely not in Indy  Keep booking the gigs Highdive Ill keep ordering Wild Turkey and Ginger AlesHave a home project or problemask the experts at Rolliers  They can help you fix it or they repair many things like screens and lampsNeed seasonal lights and decorations  Rolliers has it  Check out the Xmas display of Studio 56 stuff  The kids love it  Big kids TooGreat place to pick up items and get assistance  Need some work cloths Rolliers has it  Need paint window blinds household items electrical items Rolliers has itThe staff just assisted teaching me in how to repair a few items and help save me a ton of s  Price wise most items are competitive with other hardware places  Sometimes a little more but the experts are worth itI hate to sound like a broken record but I have to agree with my fellow reviewers PICT is a wonderful theater and production group It makes me so proud to see the talent in this city whenever I attend one of their shows I guarantee you that if you check back each season youll find at least one show to enjoy Every year their lineup changes and it always features an incredible variety of shows Ive seen a classics such as Antony and Cleopatra to the interesting but potentially uncomfortable In the Next Room or The Vibrator Play My outright favorite evening with PICT was during a premiere of a play named Our Class which was an incredibly shocking but important play about sadly real events a WWII mass murder of the Jewish community living in a town in Poland No one wanted to speak during or after that show and the actors handled the roles and portrayal of both inhumane actions and traumatic events incredibly and impressively well Kudos to them and all of PICT for tackling such an imposing but important projectI have plans to see at least one more if not two more PICT performances this year not once have they disappointed me and their contributions to the theater scene in this city are always outstanding Thank you PICTMy work had me bring a group of kids here for a field trip  This place was awesome  The old building is well maintained and great to look at  During the show all my kids were engaged  The puppeteer held there attention really well and the show was a perfect length for kids  I actually quite enjoyed the show  My only complaint was the simple fact that while it is called the Great Arizona PUPPET Theater I did not see a single puppet  They were all marionettesI would have given this place a 4 start review but they came to my site and put on a show for my kids which was extremely entertaining and quite funny they had puppets this time  I asked the puppeteer if they had later showings or shows geared more towards adults and she said they did  I am really looking forward to attend one of theseMan from reading these reviews I really though Moon was gonna be awesome but it sucked  Maybe it was just an off night there but it just seemed like a lamer version of Rain also in the Palms  It is just one boring room with a dance floor  We had bought VIP AllAccess passes and were told that they basically meant nothing and we had to wait in the line with everybody else these are the 85 blue wrist bands dont bother buying them  Also a bouncer watched a drunk guy basically dump a drink all over me and my boyfriend and didnt do anything about it  Then the elevator mass you could not call it a line was out of control but luckily we pushed through and were able to get on the next train out of Moon  Thank godI went there because of the high reviews on Yelp Im hoping next time someone sees thisRUN AWAAYYYYYYY This place blows I wanted to get a full set of acrylics with pink tips and I explained this and pointed out the tip on the display so the technician knew EXACTLY what I wanted I had gone with my friend and we were bouncing around future nail ideas and the technician decides to listen to only PART of our conversation and just starts doing something else to my nails based on PART of what he heard eavesdropping without even asking meBefore I realized what he was doing he ended up cutting my cuticle so badly we had to use the human version of QuikStop on my cuticle to stop the BLEEDING it was cut so bad He did this while using the tool that looks like sharp pliers to remove dead cuticle skin I dont get my nails done a lot so I didnt know he wasnt doing tips anymore like I asked He tried to give me a full manicure with a gel coating over the whole nail no tips without even asking me He got far enough that I had to just have him take off the mess he made so I could just leave since I had work later He tried to get me to stay and he tried to tell me that after he filed off the gel coat he had applied and then properly got the tips on it takes 40 minutes to an hour AFTER THAT to put a gel coat on I understand if the whole procedure filing putting on tips putting on gel coats that can take 40 minutes to an hour Just a top gel coat NOT that long of a procedure He took off the mess he made and I left I had work to get to and its rare I get a day off where I have time to do this He wasted my time he didnt ever communicate with me and he took stupid liberties that cost us both I would not EVER go backHeather is very personable experienced and a great bargain  There is never a hassle with making appointments she is on time she is also fast at lash extensions real fast  You wont find anyone better in the West Valley for this priceThis place was absolutely incredible  I visited in late March but it seems to be the kind of place that has a different style of beauty at different points  Ill talk about my two favorite parts the greenhouse gardens and the general gardens specifically the rock hill gardenWalking into each greenhouse was like discovering a whole new world  Ranging from tropical rooms covered in brilliant flowers and lush vines to a desert room with cactus  My only regret is that I wasnt able to run around and frolic among the plants like a little kid  I have to say my favorite greenhouses were probably 8 and 10  8 had a ton of carnivorous plants and orchids which are awesome and 10 had an Amorphophallus Titanum a plant that grows an absolutely gigantic flower Unfortunately it is in the beginning stages of this years growth but thats just an incentive to come back The rock hill garden was both visually stunning and a great place for children to play  While I was there a wedding was being held and children were running around having a wild time  If you have kids take them here they will love it  From the top of the hill you can see the Edinburgh skyline complete with castle Trust me its worth seeingWhile my beliefs are different than them as I am Christian the attitudes and behaviors I have seen here are heads and shoulders above what I have experienced at many Christian Churches I have attended on a regular basis and greatly enjoy my time and experience here on the Sundays that I am able to attend They are open and accepting of all people There are different lifestyles that I dont necessarily agree with but it is not my place to judge but to treat with respect and dignity that each human being deserves This is what I see here Rev Michelle is a class act and a genuine caring person Life is to short to condem others and that does not be occur hereYup I am in love with Pasta  Provisions Not just because they have freshly piped cannolis but also because they have such a great selection of fresh Italian fare and ingredients Plus the employees are ridiculously nice and helpfulTheir fridge selection has all sorts of delicious traditional homemade Italian goodies meatballs  marinara stuffed jumbo shells lasagna tiramisu fresh pasta etc If your seeking specialty Italian items  this is the place to go They have special canned tomatoes imported pastas wines cheeses etc that will elevate your dish to the next level They also offer large scale meals and catering for the Im pretending I can cook Italian dinner parties And back the cannolisholy yum this is the first place in Charlotte where Ive found fresh cannolisif only I could convince them to make them with pistachios Mmmm thanks Pasta  Provisions Ill be back soonThis great little shop is out of the way for most people located on Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde but it is definitely the best place to shop for cheeses and cured meats in Las Vegas The owners are helpful and the selection is vast They recently added to go farm baskets full of organic vegetables so you can get almost everything you need for a dinner right here Plus they have wine tasting classes Be sure to get the artisan zzang chocolate bars Theyre fantasticTime to say goodbyethats all Im sayingives me goosebumpsthis fountain soothes my soulHabibbbbbb is the rudest meanest uglyist guy I have ever seen as a owner of restaurant He treats his persian customer so badly like he is living in Iran or Afghanestan  He thinks persian people here dont have any right in his restaurant  last time we were a party of 10  waiting 2 hours  not that it was crowded  but because he just had one waiter  the worker are terrified of him  The food has very low quality small portion  uncooked but the price was so high He charged 35 gratitude which comes with the bill and we had no choice  but to pay  Bad experience  never go back and dont suggested to anyone dont let the environment follish youThis is a great place I pop in here all the time They always have what I need and the prices are usually lower than elsewhereI rented tables chairs dishes silverware and goblets for my sons outside wedding Everything looked wonderful The lady who helped me gave some wonderful suggestions  We had no problems with delivery and there was no problem with the orderI highly recommend using them for all your event needsPerfect location with a warm friendly staff  What more could you ask for  Everyone from the valets to front desk staff were wonderful  Our room was clean and looked to have been remodeled in the last couple of years  When we mentioned we were in Charlotte for a sick relative kids in tow and that it was our anniversary they delivered chocolate covered fruit to our room  If you book through their website the prices are very reasonableI love this place  I live out of state and recently called Elizabeth Arden for a gift certificate for my motherinlaw for Mothers Day  I have done this annually for her for several years and she had always loved the service  I must admit that I was going to go to a less expensive place this yearcut backs and the economy  After reading reviews online I selected a nail spa close by  The service was really horrible on the phone  I can only imagine what it would have been like in person  I ended up not purchasing a gift certificate from them and instead coming back to Elizabeth Arden again  Yes I spent twice as much for her mothers day presentbut I would rather pay double verses deal with poor service and questionable product  When my motherinlaw comes here she is always happy and feels pampered on her special day  And they really do gift certificates well  I will not shop around againJodena is wonderful if you need a Brazilian wax I am moving to the Phoenix area in about 6 months but was in town over the holidays and decided to try this Elizabeth Arden location since I go to another one where I currently live for Brazilians I am sooo glad I did because now I know where I can get an awesome wax once I move Jodena was so nice and got it ALL I cant wait to go backA beautiful little bar with an exciting martini list  do step outside your comfort zone and try one of the crafted drinksRecently attended the Neighborhood Theatre wants to say CONGRATULATIONS to the The Latin American Coalition  Charlotte NC for selling out the event and it being only their 2nd year doing the event The vendors were great the people were fully participative and everyone had a great time BCBS USAirways Cricket etc had great giveaways Ill be back next year The Venue was a pretty good size nice size music hall for concerts plays and festivals Check out their production line up and see for yourself Im sure you all will be pleased I was and will definitely be back for more funAwesome  Simply the best Apple Fritter Ive ever had in my life  And cheapSTRONG coffee  Youve been warned Great tasting bubble tea options super friendly staff  and right atmosphere for State St Highly suggestThe coffee isnt good and they dont seem to care If youre a local I get that its the only game in town but this place isnt worth traveling for I really wanted to like tazza doro Ive been several times hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences I drink espresso I know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn I have no complaints about paying 300 for an espresso but if it isnt right and I let you know you should probably try again The last time I went in both baristas admitted they hadnt triedpulled the espresso I ordered The gentlemen working there who was very nice pulled my shot I tried it and it was very sour I let the girl standing directly in front of me know that I didnt think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment ya well we just got it Silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you just got to taste goodThis place clearly isnt going anywhere in the near future Its a favorite with locals who like to hangout there Its just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they dont seem to care about actually pulling it offVery cool placeA serious waste of time  If you happen to catch it while walking by then go for it but dont waste your time waiting around for this to happenSo glad Tempe has an area like this a few miles down Mill and you feel like youre in another town Nothing but green everywhere and waterlove itWent to the batting cages for 125 you get 14 pitches you got poolslakebasketballtennis courts you can even pay to join games i believejust an all around cool place for some physical activities And cheap at thatThis is a beautiful and well manicured golf course  It is quite a drive to get there and a ten minute drive to get to the first hole  There are only about 6 homes on the entire course  There are many  holes with tremendous elevation changes on the par threes It is a tough course but fair There are very few players and the pace of play is good unless your game is off Their food is excellent and reasonably pricedNicks a cool dude and knows his music Hes also an avid concert goer and music hound If he cant find it no one canIm new to Pittsburgh so I wanted to try out all the local spots first and let me tell you This spot is definitely worth a try Its a cute diner with a lot of local charm The prices are awesome and the food is even better I had the cinnamon raisin french toast with the home fries and a coffee All of it was really good Im not a complainer but Im picky and honestlyI have nothing but good things to say about this place I highly recommend you stop by and give it a try You can thank me later I must of went on a bad day Sunday around 4 Everyone was very disrespectful Would not acknowledge me at the bar She was too busy chatting with the strippers One stripper gave my friend a dance without even asking She was definitely on something I could keep going Not worth coming back The attitudes here in general ruined our nightOver the past five years Ive been to this convention center four times and have enjoyed each time here Its an impressive and well maintained building that provides both locals and outoftowners with a good impression of the city The first time at the center I lived in NC and was attending a big work event here I was very impressed by the architecture of the center but sadly wasnt in an area where I could see beautiful views of the city After moving to Pittsburgh I came for the annual home show and auto show Though I liked both shows the auto show was a bit more impressive I hear that the home and garden show is a mustattend Finally I came here for the Boden liquidation sale yesterday The views from the line to enter where I sat for a looong time were absolutely stunning The section of the center overlooked the river and the North Shore with a bridge flanking both sides of the view I didnt mind the wait just because I could admire the view I look forward to coming back for the home and garden and auto shows in 2014Tried this place several times on the chance the first time I went they were just having an off night I was wrongThe bartender and the server were rudeand the prices sky highboth times left me with a bad taste in my mouthenough saiddont waste your timeBig fan  First time i have ever been to this place and the milkshake I got was delicious  My mother also got a frozen coffee and I think I wound up drinking all of it for herThe cookies that were there also were great  I am not sure whether they cooked them there fresh or not but they were delicious  Defiantly the best stop my mother and I had while we were on Walnut street and i would venture back to the place in a secondPS the wait staff was also very pleasant and kindI am one of those people who needs to put things in my coffee I cant drink it black  La Prima Espresso Company has actually broken me out of this habit I went back here several times over a 3 day period during my visit in Pittsburgh We stumbled across this cute Italian coffee shop on our way to watch the runners at the Pittsburgh Marathon I needed coffee and I needed it now This was the first place I saw  To my amazement the coffee was probably some of the best Ive had I kid you not  I did not have to put anything in it I did add some cinnamon though  It is fantastic  Perfectly brewed to perfection  I even bought a bag of beans of La Primas own Grow Pittsburgh brand bold flavor that they have made locally Its deliciousThis is a really authentic Italian coffee shop attached to a bakery and a wonderful find right off The Strip in Downtown PittsburghThis place is horrid They are discriminatory and I will NEVER come back They are also horribly organized FAILAll righty I have eaten sushi in Boston NYC Portland ME Phily Chicago San Diego to name a few This place is the best ever and I have never been disappointed Located In Mt Lebanon a cool little suburb of Pittsburgh This resturant does not mess around The owner pays top dollar for all of his seafood and the chefs there are top notch In the back of the resturant is a Japanese kitchen where you can order then watch 1 woman cook your food Great spot for a date And Best Sushi this side of the missisipIve been a patient of Dr Wyse for several years I have always booked my appointments first thing in the morning to avoid waiting in the little white room too long After the third time of waiting over an hour after arriving at 730 in the morning and nothing more than a im very booked as an apology Ive decided its best to move on and find a new family doctor There are some rare services or individuals that are worth the extra wait This unfortunately is not one of them I find it very arrogant when anyone feels their time is more important than yoursI love CrackerJax because it is super fun I had a strong desire to go to some batting cages because for some reason I used to go a lot as a kid when I was living in AZ Plus why wouldnt you like it Or maybe Im just weird But from not even handling a bat in almost 10 years I wasnt half bad I apparently was so good that this little 5 yr old boy started watching me called his Dad over to watch told me how impressed he was and then gave me a high five Um awesome Definitely the highlight of the evening Its kind of sad that I felt so happy about a little kid giving me a high five but hey it was pretty cool We also decided to do the bumper boats and the go karts My bf got my Mom and her bf to do the go karts with us which she wouldnt usually do Super fun I was scared to do it since I havent even driven a car in 6 years but it was soooo much fun We ended up doing it 4 more timesQuiet  2 mile walk around the golf course all manicured lawns flowers etc The club house is great and included  best place in Vegas area to liveThe sushi during happy hour is great The wife and I eat well for 20  Thats drinking pop though  Dont judgeI loved it when I was there The staff was very friendly and the decor was so interesting I had the prawns  they were a bit bland but not awful Until I woke up with food poisoning I was so sick I could not move  I had to change my flight out of Vegas and stay an extra day just to recover Be very careful The meal was quite expensive and I am disgusted to think of what the kitchen must look like for me to get so sickThis club is great fun nights good bar good food They are open Tuesday for Jazz Night Friday for card night Saturday dinner and dancing and one Sunday a week for Fruschoppen or Brunch  Please check out the website of GASCON if you need infoWell Im afraid I cannot give a fair review We arrived shortly after 8 PM and there were slim pickins left on the buffet and they werent in any hurry to put fresh food out What little food I did try was OK Will have to give it another shot at an earlier time I evening I guess Very disappointed this time aroundLovely place this salt room helps me to breath better And the crew was very kind and helpful I definitely will go back And they have this  amazing playground for kids Thank you Salt Room for a great timeThis museum is fantastic We recently visited it on vacation I have a 8 year old and an almost 5year old They have a pretend area for younger kids  It is a bit young for my kids but of course they still loved it The exhibits in the museum were well thought out with opportunities for children to experiment in all different mediums For example one of the two exhibits was called Table Manners We could read books about table manners experiment with chopsticks and play food make table scapes and then draw them and much more And then of course there was the art They had a nice selection again in different mediums Museum was clean staff was friendly and overall we will visit again if in townHuge place with a variety of activities to doGreat if you want to spend 18 to see lots and lots and lots of cactusI love love love their meat They must sprinkle it with crack or something cus those sandwiches are addicting lolI was here on 103 and I have to say this was a horrible experience  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards  It took the waitress at least 1015 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again  We ordered and got our drinks and well lets just say we didnt see the waitress again until she was giving us our check some manager delivered the food to the table  No refill on my beverage no how is your food no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people  I will not be back again to eatBest karate center everHighly recommend attending Teachers are firm but fair Facility is good and students are friendlyMy groomsman and I bought the suits for my wedding here 4 of us that I know were sized wrong  Customer service was terrible After we purchased our suits they would not correct it  Highly recommend not buying a suit here  These people do not know what theyre doingSometimes I come all the way to Pittsburgh from Akron JUST to visit Eons  The employees are friendly  knowledgeable  The clothing is very well organized separated by era and then by size  This is one of the only vintage clothing stores Ive been to in the country that has a large selection of deadstock items complete with their original tags  The dresses I have purchased here are absolutely amazing many of them never worn  I will continue to visit on my quarterly Pburgh visitsWhat a pleasant surprise this place was  Great wine list terrific food and a totally awesome contemporary decor The ambiance and lighting were perfect and the space created a very relaxed modern vibe which was not at all what I was expecting from the outside Its in a strip mall in a Frys lot and looks from the outside like an average mom and pop pizza joint but its totally chic and cool inside  My husband and I are pretty picky about our italian food and we liked everything that we ordered I especially liked the eggplant parmesan sub I had it was one of the best Ive ever had The wine flights are really great you can choose 4 of your own picks or go with one of their themes The pours are generous you get what equals at least 2 full glasses when you order a flight We will definitely be going backI dont know what I am doing writing a review for this store that no one at least no one with any ability to change anything there will ever read  Nevertheless I came I saw I left empty handed as nothing in truth not one little thing in my entire basket rang up as it was marked on the shelf  I dont know if it is incompetence stupidity or a laudable I dont give a flying f attitude that makes this the worst Michaels in the area but I am not sure I have the time to devote to studying the subject matter  I think my favorite part of todays experience was when the third item rang up wrong and I told the cashier she said oh and looked blindly like a deer in headlights No Ill check on that for you no do you still want it just a blank stare  Sadly Ill be back next week because this is the closest one when I am out and about  But seriously as soon as I find an acceptable online substitute I am outta hereIf you are looking for a classic Catholic church in Phoenix this is it St Marys Basilica has a beautiful sounding choir wonderful priests and a historically Catholic feel with architecture and structure I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day Ive been going to St Marys Basilica for years Ironically enough Father Vince who is a priest at St Marys Basilica used to be the priest at St Isidores in Danville California which was the church I went to when I was growing up During the holidays I make sure I attend mass at St Marys Basilica Theres something about the architecture music and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times However its also a great church for Sunday mass Around 7 years ago my sister married her husband at St Marys Basilica  and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister her husband myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony There isnt much more I can say about St Marys Basilica in this review but I will end this by saying that each Mass is a different experience and its based on the person attending but be sure to visit this church and attend a Mass so see if its right for youA favorite spot for lunch on weekends God  I hate you guys This restaurant makes me want to move to Tempe  Does not compare to ONE not even ONE sandwich place I can think of in the east bay  I got the Pecan chicken salad sandwich and Billy got the steak sandwich hands down best sandwich this side of the fucking mississippi  All outdoor seating so be forewarned if the weather is not good youll have to maybe escape to an air conditioned car somewhere to enjoy your mayo while its still goodOne thing I just cant understand  We were steered to this place by two peeps at the Frys down the street after atleast five minutes of head scratch  Now wait one goshdern second people  How could you even question the all supreme sandiwch gods when it comes to the caliber of this place  Please  If I worked at a Frys nearby this place would be my fucking fall back plan in a second  Ill stop nowhas an awesome relaxed feeling when entering seating on comfy couches and chairs very cleanhas lucille ball stuff all round fall tree and very cute decor that did it oh and the wine too   bruschetta traditional is perfect w drink loved itAndys sushi bar is a convenient little stand set up inside Whollys in the Strip District of Pittsburgh Its not a dine in type of place but it is the best sushi Ive ever had Whollys sells fresh fish and other meats so a very convenient place for a sushi bar My personal favorite of Andys is the Philadelphia roll  without hot sauce I used to work in the strip and would often walk down to Whollys just to get sushi and talk to AndyIts been yearsbut I loved going to shows here while I attended ISU  Very intimate venue to see your fave bands play with good food and libationsI went to the Sunday night Salsa lessons at Paragon There were about 200 people for the salsa group lessons It was a noisy zoo Men far outnumbered women but during the course of the lesson it almost evened out Lots of partner switching  in fact switching is almost all we did That has its advantages if your main goal is to hold hands with lots of partners I have certainly heard a lot of hype about Paragon but the studio left me kind of cold I dont see how anybody could learn to dance there The quality of instruction isnt close to other local studios I have been to Of course maybe the instruction was better than I knew since it was almost impossible to see or hear the instructor and individual attention is out of the question I gave them another try on a Thursday for a West Coast Swing lesson The quality of instruction wasnt good and we had distractions because other group lessons and privates were given in the same ballroom They have other small ballrooms so there was little excuse to cram everybody into the main ballroom I watched a private lesson and wasnt impressed by what I saw Paragon is probably popular because of the dances after the lessons but the music wasnt for beginners So if you want to learn dancing go somewhere else for meat markets do Paragon Their prices and quality will appeal to anyone who thinks McDonalds is a great dealI searched on yelp and made a few calls for permanent makeup eyebrows based on reviews When I called the Montage they said Cindie did brows but she wasnt in they gave me her cell number and said I could call her directly I called left her a message and she returned my call and would be happy to see me 2 hours later The salon is higher end and quite nice the staff were friendly and nice Cindie was there ready for me The room was very clean and comfortable Cindie is very experienced doing permanent makeup since 1991 She drew the perfect brows on me and we got to work immediately Quick easy minimal pain and Cindie was an absolute pleasure I am so happy with my new brows AFantastic food Best atmosophere in Charlotte A true local tradition Make sure to stop in for a pintHorrible experience For the past 20yrs Ive always belonged to a gym This was the worst ever I started by signing up with a personal trainer he was awesome however I ended up having major hand surgery on both hands and was unable to finish my last 4 sessions After many attempts to speak to someone and Im talking weeks for someone to get back with me LTF refused to reimburse me for he last 4 sessions I also feel like 120 a month for a single person is way over the limit especially for a gym that has out dated equipment I belonged to Lowes YMCA 65 a month and that gym makes LTF look like a dumpOriginally posted 792010Just wanted to warn Yelpers about this place We made reservations in March for an October wedding party and were told today July 6 that everyones reservations have been cancelled The bridetobe was told that a higherpaying party had reserved that date and that literally Thats life They have an F rating with the Better Business Bureau now we all know whyEdit 9182012Id like to thank Dave for the sincere apology Ive received here on Yelp two years and nearly three months after the factsheila is always so vibrant and excited to perform her face painting i see her at all the yelp events and by the looks of so many people with face paintings she does a fun and great job if i had kids id book her for a partygreat job sheila and thanks for always being so nice and friendlyTHT has to be the worst ice cream shop that I have been to I walked in expecting a varied of ice creams and come to see that they do not have much to choose from I ask for the basic flavor strawberry and they did not carry it The person over the counter seemed confused and did not know what he was doing I did not even bother to order a smoothie seeing how bad the place lookedWhoever says that this place is better than the SGV dim sum restaurants must be trully stupid or get their head bang in the shower This place is horrendous If you see the color of the chicken feet you  know that its not going to taste good The rest of the food seems cooked too long and the service is slowI mean I understand when you go to chinese restaurant you expect the service to suck ass cos thats the way they operate but when you have the owner operating as cashier that tell the customer to pay upfront then you should just open a to go counter instead of a full dining restaurantIf you dont know how to open a full seating restaurant go slow open a little to go place firstI went on September 1st and I have to say I was miserable  It was over 6500 for two adults and a 5yr and 8yr old  We waited in a long line front from the begining and then went to see a movie  The movie was good and we did like that but everything else was poor  This place is beautiful on the outside but a poor set up on the inside  Hot and humid and the butterfly exhibit though beautiful had dead ends in each section It would of been more functional to keep it going with the walk way so it was not so congested Also the ant exhibit was horrible and the fish tanks were really no big deal  We live in Arizona so we know what scorpions are  Just think the fee to get in was way to much for what you were given  The cafeteria cost 1300 for two bags of candy and two juice boxes and then you leave thru the gift store which every kid was complaining as they wanted a toy or somthing  Clever on the store part but not fair to the parents  We bought a plastic butterfly ring and with tax as 491 for a 10 cent ring I will never go back and I bet this will be closed down before to long   Sorry but have to be honestThis is truly a beautiful place and a treasure for Madison  Please dont ever leave us  Be sure to check out the herb garden in the fall  Amazing variety of scents  The varieties of  geranium are amazing  Lemon chocolate mint vanilla pepper cinnamon turmeric well you get the pictureBEWARE Joe the red head manager is crook He treats people very rude He will also try to burn you They should get rid of this guy I will never use this pawn shop for purchase or loansThis used to be a favorite place of mine The service standards have gone downhill quite a bit One example is I waited 10 minutes for a refill on iced tea at the bar The food is still outstanding but I think I will take my hard earned money to Sals Gilbert Pizza You have truly let me down PestosGreat Place if you have a lot of time to waste      Heres the breakdown estimate time in increments of 5 minsabout 5 mins to get seatedanother 5 to get take our drinks10 mins to get the drinks and order our food10 mins for the food to arrive 10 mins into eating      hmm      wheres our server10 mins has past drink cups are empty        hmm    should I get a APB on our server15 mins later       how was everything  Whoa his aliveanother 5 mins to get the check    wait my automatic watch stopped working       All in all the food is mediocre but with molasses type service and contraband prices this place to needs to be banned just like their cigarsWouldnt change a thing about the Sand Dollar  Great music check dive bar check out of the way location check  All these elements make for a true blues bar in a city where artifice has been wrongfully escalated to an art form  Music that feeds your soul in a nofrills environment that wont bastardize the experience  Out of the way for most tourists if theyre any there they love the blues  Thats what its all about so good you can almost taste itAre they closed now This phone number says its disconnected Would be nice to have it forward to another location I miss Fiesta Mall I remember it when it was brand new Seeing Santa It was the hot spot to hang out back in the day this is one of my favorite places to go in the valley always a blast The book buyer is extremely rude very put out to do HER job I wont be returning My husband had the same experience yesterday and I decided it was time to write a review He ended up giving a nice bum some great booksWalking into this shop is like giving your eyes a sweet indulgence and the sensory aromatics of freshly roasted beens will leave your taste buds craving for that hot java  Rows of specialty coffees teas and candies line the walls  and create the feeling of a genuinely unique experience Its got a small town feel which is rmost efreshing for a Downtown location Specialty drinks are their modus operandi like the Chocolate Banana Bread Latte or my humour favorite Fat Guy in a Little Coat Latte I have been in a number of times both in busy rush hours and during the inbetween hours The service has ALWAYS been friendly efficient  creative so dont hesitate to ask a few questions and try a new combination Im also a huge loose tea fan and have yet to explore this aspect of the shop They seem to have an impressive inventory This is the BEST coffee and speciality  bean shoppe in Pittsburgh hands downHorrible horrible horrible  9 ladies for a birthday lunch 35 minutes passed before the wine we ordered was delivered another 30 to 45 minutes before our order was taken and then at least 45 minutes before our entrees were brought out one plate at a time  The owner  came by to address our concerns and had one excuse after another as to why things went wrong  When I told him numerous calls to reserve a table went unanswered calls went directly to a voice message saying they were open for lunch and dinner he said we have a digital system didnt you get directed to prompts Even if I did get said prompts who wants to make a reservation for a simple lunch the same way you are trying to have a conversation with your credit card company  I said no all I got was a dial tone   I then told him  their website directed me to opentablecom to make a reservation I went to opentable only to get a message Narcisse is no longer a member  The owners response  Our problem with opentable is that we are a nightclub  What in the world does that mean  If you are a nightclub be a nightclubdo not tout yourself as a lunchdinner restaurant  We are an easy going group of women age 40 to 60 who meet once a month for lunch price is never an issue and we never ever do the dreaded separate check thing so rarely have issues but this outing was absolutely the worst experience we have ever had individually or collectivelyAddictiveIndoor gokarting at high speeds   They give a full print out of your success  You can gauge best lap progress over the 12 lap race etcGood in a large groupI did 48 laps and wanted moreDafegreat food friendly staff pumpkin curry is freaking deliciousHad to find a new powder coater since my usual place went out of business recently  After a lot of checking a round I ended up here  Glad I did Great work fair price  quick turn aroundCant believe there are many reviews after my first one years ago To be honest I dont go there any more for few reasons 1 The owner has changed2 The foods quality has changed3 Service is NOT as good as it used to be 4 The original chief seem to be long gone 5 Found a better places to have the best DIM SUM in Chandler AZOnce very satisfied customer is no longer their customer If you want real good Chinese foods and restaurant services go somewhere else I guess I will never know how good their foods now Dont even want to tryI agree with Ian below as well The Moonlight Masquerade event was the worst planned event Ive ever attended There was absolutely no theme concept the music was atrociously paired and half of the acts were unlistenable they quickly ran out of food drinks and souvenirs within 45 minutes and THE TICKETS WERE 60 FRIKKIN DOLLARS The Botanical Garden was quickly becoming a great cultural institution for its well planned and designed events its great variety of performers and entertainment and its ties to the arts community in the valley I have heard from exvolunteers that all the talented people in the events department have quit or been fired in the last six months because the dimwit department heads dont want to lose their jobs They are now breaking contracts with performers treating guest artists and garden staff poorly getting cheap and poor quality entertainment and misplanning their events Its too bad Looks like a bunch of fools are running the place now and I am disappointed because DBG has the potential to be a real cultural institution in Phoenix  a city that has far too fewNeeded supplies for a home brew and I work in Mesa I thought I was going to have to drive all the way into Tempe and get stuff from those other guys I completely forgot about a small little store in a business park I remember seeing EVERY DAY when I drive to work like an idiot Much to my surprise these guys were awesome I may have been the only guy in the store but they gave me superb service advice and showed me around a little bit The store was very clean and organized with almost everything in stock I will continue to make this my only LHBS and recommend them to allThis place rocks  I am glad that I work nearby because otherwise I might not have found it the parking lot is a bit large and desolate which only adds to the feeling like you have found somewhere special and perhaps unknown by many  I met Bob the owner and he was so helpful and friendly  He even told me exactly how to use an oil that I purchased from him and showed me some of the cool things he has picked up from around the world that are not for sale  This place is charming and a great place to find cool and unusual things in commercialized Las Vegas  Oui ouiI love Louie Anderson and Ive been really looking forward to seeing him live This was not a disappointment The venue is nicely intimate so you really feel like youre getting a good live show not just watching something on TV Ive been following his standup for years and Ive read most of his books so I feel like I already know all the people hes joking about like his parents and siblings Louie definitely tailors his show for the specific audience so youll likely get a different show every time you see him One of the biggest laughs he got was when he was lamenting that we cant just change the constitution and vote Bill Clinton back in The whole audience appreciated that oneI loved that he really took time to chat with people who stood in line to buy books tshirts andor DVDs and signed everything It really makes a difference from a lot of comedians who wont even emerge from the green room except to perform then sneak out the backLouie was excellent and if you already like his humour this show will be a great experiencePS   Drink service was attentive and the opener was great too which is also a rarityI have lived not 5 miles from the fabulous market and just never noticed it or went in till yesterday What a FIND Fresh farm eggs Local artisanal cheeses I bought a black truffle parmesan chunk and it is so rich and delicious I also bought some  Holy Hummus  OMG it is so luscious and fresh This is family run and the woman who checked me out could not have been nicer The produce was spectacular This is a gem in my own neighborhood that I just discoveredGreat food and atmosphere  Very upscale and friendly  Favorite is the kickass filet for dinner  Great lunch specials tooShabu Fondue only opened a few nights ago and they are already off to a great start We were so impressed with the variety of the menu and ended up ordering two different broths both of which were spicy and delicious We ordered a ton of ingredients but the pork dumplings and grassfed beef were by far favorites at our table We were lucky enough to have chefowner Johnny Chu stop by our table probably three times just to chat and see what we liked and what we didnt A great experience overallAfter months of passing this place and wanting to try their food we finally made it to KKL  What we werent expecting from this place was the very pricey menu for fish shrimp and chips french fries from a bag Im sure  The shrimp was different and tastey I had 4 pieces with chips and also a side of mushrooms  Chris had clams chips and a side of cole slaw and of course we ordered the hushpuppies which everyone raves about  This meal was close to 30 dollars   Some people may feel that isnt bad for lunch at a seafood place however for the area the food which isnt like just from the ocean its from a bag  its way too much money and your gut will feel like a grease pit after eating hereMy advice skip this place if you canESC is my home away from home  It is a bright light that shines my way I feel the peace radiating from AlaricFILET MIGNON NOT AS ADVERTISEDWe ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi  The flavor was ok we asked for the filet to be medium and it arrived well done was very chewy and we suspect a chuck roast or some other inferior cut of beef was substituted for the filet  False advertising at its bestshouldnt that be illegalThe fried rice that came with it was ok but we were not offered a choice of steamed rice or noodles  Other hibachi places we have been to plate noodles and steamed or fried rice togetherThe miso soup was very salty and murky and not very flavorful  The salad had a lot of water at the bottom of the bowl and was made up of head lettuce only anyone ever heard of a salad spinnernot very appetizingWe also ordered sushi all cooked ingredients it was just ok and not the best I have experiencedThe waitress was slow and had to be asked for refills on our hot tea  The whole meal took almost an hour and a half and cost 7500 tip included  Not worth the price time gas and wear and tear on the car to get there']"
